"I first read Tukey's book maybe 30 years ago. It had a profound effect on me. I had always spent time playing with data: this analysis, that analysis, various plots, etc. But I had never thought of it as something that could be approached in a systematic way, and that that there were many ""easy"" back-of the envelope techniques for getting a sense of your data to quickly understand what you had. In a sense Tukey licensed the idea that data was fun to play with and something that you could just fiddle with as much as you wanted.I think of it as in the same class as mental arithmetic: sure, you have a calculator on your phone; but it's way too slow to get out of your pocket and poke at the screen when all you want is 7*9 or even 387/3. Stem-and-leaf plots let you get a quick idea of what's there, without having to write some script. These skills come in handy all the time.Like everyone, I use a computer for non-trivial data analysis. But Tukey is usually in there, somewhere. For example his box-and-whisker diagrams are in many if not all plotting packages. They look nice and you might even have used them. But understanding the original insights lets you use these tools more effectively.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classic)
"I was not surprised to see that one of the issues raised by previous reviewers is whether or not this book is still relevant, given the enormous improvements in computing since this book was written. While I recognize that there are a lot of good ideas in this book, I must say that far too much of the text is devoted to techniques that are only relevant if one is doing data analysis on paper. This is certainly not to slander Tukey's own extensive knowledge of computing -- simply an admission of the fact that when EDA was written, few readers would have had access to any computing resources, let alone anything comparable to those that are available today. Today, the books suffers for this. A new version of this book, updated to take advantage of today's computing resources, would be quite valuable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classic)

"This book was pubished at the perfect moment for me while establishing a new TI function in my organisation. It is THE seminal book on the topic, and makes important distinctions between TI and people analytics and how TI complements both workforce/people analytics and recruitment analytics/KPIs. It is an important read for any organisation that has recognized that TI is critical in the early phases of location, organizational structuring, and workforce planning at a time when there is shortage of talent in almost every industry and type of role, from blue collar service technicians and factory and construction workers to software developers to executives in any field. The book provides a clear definition of this emerging field and insight on the trade-offs involved for organisations of any size when deciding what the TI function should do, where it should be located within an organisation, the types of data, tools, and skills necessary to leverage external market data not only to plan tactical talent sourcing and recruitment strategy, but also site location, M&A, go-to-market strategy, talent attraction, diversity planning, competitor organisational analysis, and more. It makes a strong case for partnership between TI and other types of market and financial intelligence as well as how the TA function can be a more strategic partner to the business by leveraging open source market data, proprietary databases, and the as-yet-untapped vast broad market insight recruitment teams gain not only about compensation and benefits and talent but also products, technology, and workplace trends in the market.An extensive chapter summarizing use cases from many different companies and industries is extremely helpful in making the business case for TI and planning TI projects. The book provides information estimating how much time and person-hours might be required for certain kinds of analyses and what both stakeholders and analysts can expect from a new TI function given the organisation's resource constraints.Since TI is a new field, the book acknowledges where the field is going and potential directions in which TI can develop. The author is transparent about sources, definitions, areas of ambiguity.The book is a ""living document"", complemented by the Talent Intelligence Collective Podcast and social media communities, where the definitions and topics in the book are discussed and often refined.Anyone involved in founding a new company, CEOs, and Talent Acquisition leaders making decisions about where to locate, what kinds of people they should hire first, what kinds of benefits and messaging will attract those people, and which organisations they are working for now should start with this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Talent Intelligence: Use Business and People Data to Drive Organizational Performance
"This book is amazing! As I was reading this, it felt like Toby was working alongside me for the last few years, taking notes, and making suggestions. He then jumped into his DeLorean Time Machine went into the future and wrote this book. Then came back to 2022 and published it.Seriously. Great read! Easy to understand concepts that might be outside of the traditional TA functions, but is able to tie it back to hiring activities. Dare I say, this book, Toby, and the whole collective are doing for Talent Intelligence like what the ""Phoenix Project"" did for DevOps.

"I regard Scott E. Page's The Model Thinker to be the singular 'must read' reference work and learning aid for anyone looking to master conceptual models of the world we live in. For the most part, these are dynamic models, most frequently mathematically described, which are essential to thinking about data; interactions, including conflict, strategies for resolving conflicts between individuals and their respective social groups, institutions, and generally speaking, civilized society itself. A single work of this type cannot include every single permutation of conceptual model; but Professor Page accomplishes a great deal in the 420-odd pages comprising this masterful work.As Professor Page observes, early on, ""we live in a time awash in information and data"". At the same time, our innate abilities to comprehend and deal with the mental load that those data represent, and how to respond appropriately, requires us to acquire new cognitive skills in order to make any headway in dealing with the implications that those data represent.Professor Page identifies seven uses of models: (1) to reason, meaning to identify conditions and deduce logical implications; (2) to explain, meaning to provide testable explanations for empirical phenomena; (3) to design, meaning to choose features of institution, policies, and rules of behavior that will allow particular models to behave as intended; (4) to communicate, meaning to relate knowledge and understandings about the natural world, and human-developed institutions, as they interact with one another; (5) to act, we need to guide policy choices and strategic actions to achieve predictable results; (6) to predict, meaning to make numerical and categorical statements about future and unknown phenomena, based upon historical data or extrapolating from current data, where the trend lines are predicting where we will end up at some point in the future; and finally, (7) to explore, in which we may need to investigate possibilities, hypotheticals, including counterfactuals. The models that Professor Page presents are not reality, but the functions that they explore are found in reality if we look closely enough to find them and are capable of understanding what they are telling us and where we are heading. They are simple, and yet sophisticated. They employ depictions of both physics, and psychology, and a great deal more.In 29 chapters, Professor Page limns the universe of conceptual models and their mathematical and-graphical representations, how they work, and the logical inferences that can be drawn from each of them in terms of the types of outcomes that can be expected when those models are employed to explain numerical, financial, organizational and sociological phenomena. The mathematics described an input-process-output scenario where they simulate natural processes that behave stochastically as if they were governed by predictable mathematical rules.Professor Page repeatedly emphasizes that understanding phenomena, and the data that describes them, requires a knowledge of many models, each one pointing out a specific facet of the whole, and none of them completely describing what the whole actually looks like. TIn many respects, these models are counterintuitive, meaning that left to our own devices we might come to different decisions based upon criteria that fall well short of rational calculation.Nowadays, the science of behavioral economics has, through extensive research, established that in fact, decision-makers are subject to cognitive biases that distort our perception of reality, importance, and value. We perceive and think in much the same way that our ancient forebears did, before formal learning took hold. We as a species are risk aversive by a factor of two over what we might gain from a prospective course of action. We act on the basis of unfounded assumptions and cognitive biases. And this is why dynamic modeling become so important in order to strip away the cognitive tricks that our minds play on us when we encounter new and unfamiliar situations. Using these models, we apply rule-based behaviors that have been time-tested to optimize our chances of succeeding in whatever endeavor we are then engaged.Using dynamic modeling techniques, we also learn to adapt our behavior, based upon the behaviors of others, by applying principles of probability that allow us to calculate the likelihood that certain events will occur, or will not. We learn to adjust our behaviors based upon what happened in the past, but understanding that our revised calculations are still educated guesswork.We also come to understand, as Professor Page teaches us, that different models lead to different outcomes: equilibrium; cycles; randomness or complexity. If a rule-based model generates a random outcome, the rule itself serves only to alert the user that the outcome of the action taken is limited in its predictability; nevertheless, randomness itself can be studied, and the lessons applied, to rule out situations where precise calculations would be necessary to achieve the model user's objectives. Moreover, as Professor Page instructs us, some models generating what at first glance may appear to be randomness may actually be recurring patterns that derive from an extended number of cycles. Now that we can use computers to simulate actions taken over time, the regularity of those secular outcomes can readily be seen. If a model produces an equilibrium, we know that certain actions will ultimately succeed, and others will fail. Other models produce complexity, both internally, and through their interaction with other actors above and below the level at which the model operates. We learned that those complex interactions generate what is referred to as 'emergent behaviors', sometimes higher levels of sophistication, but also phenomena that could not have been anticipated at the operational level at which those models work. This is how models, and those who use them, adapt to changing circumstances.We can also see where particular models favor selfish outcomes at the expense of the community at large, and where the community response to its disadvantage in the economic sphere by changing the rules of engagement through public policy changes that are intended to restrict or deter overreaching by those considered to be bad actors. More on that later.At the core of all models are the notions of statistical distributions, and the way in which probabilities are to be calculated. They are part of the core knowledge base for any modeler, because they determine the ways in which data are perceived and handled. A working knowledge of distributions is necessary to measure inequalities in power, income and wealth, and to perform statistical tests.Professor Page addresses the matter of distributions over two chapters, the first dealing with normal (Gaussian) distributions, often referred to as the Bell Curve. The next chapter deals with power law distributions, i.e., long-tailed events. Distributions mathematically capture variations in diversity within certain types, representing them as probabilities as defined over numerical values or categories, with the bulk of them ordinarily clustered around the statistical mean or average value, with parameters of difference represented as deviations from the mean in a standardized format. Power distributions differ from normal distributions, whereby positive feedback loops augment and reinforce the action or trend that the distribution explains or describes. Two models frequently appear where power laws occur; the first is described as preferential attachment that captures trending preferences about where people choose to live (i.e., cities); which things to buy (i.e., books that become wildly popular simply as a function of either their subject matter or word-of-mouth advertising); certain places on the Internet (i.e. websites such as Facebook), and so on. The second model may consist of self-organized criticality in the form of default choices that lead to predictable consequences, and where under conditions of entropy, where a power law distribution maximizes uncertainty hovering around a fixed mean, but with a proximity to large events that, although they occur infrequently, can have devastating consequences.Along these timelines, normality is correlated in the minds of many observers with frequency of occurrence, a conclusion justified by the number of smaller events clustered around the historical averages during the relevant time periods in the run-up to the present day. It would be as if we are traveling on a highway accelerating as we go, and viewing the highway through the rearview mirror. It is but a small leap of faith to jump to the conclusion that the future will not be markedly different from the past; and the historical record often validates that assumption. Using the normal bell curve to justify that conclusion is really asking the wrong question, because it inherently incorporates the so-called 'survivors bias', those who have averted or avoided catastrophe and lived to tell the tale. At best, it is a psychological pick-me-up that reassures us that whatever happens in the future is survivable, because we have done it before.Well, not entirely, because by focusing on survivable events (because we, or most of us did survive), instead of looking at the risks we are incurring now, with fewer resources and less resilience to withstand future shocks. We have come to realize that statistical probabilities of those large, infrequently experienced events, as represented within a nominal ‘normal distribution’ tend to understate the likelihood that those events will ever occur. In recent decades, for example, turmoil within the financial markets was regarded by many as ‘unforeseeable’; well, those events had been foreseen, and warned against. The argument against foreseeability was simply that it was impolitic, unfashionable, and unprofitable for many to acknowledge the obvious risk that major financial services institutions were running at the time. Accounting for that potentially large downside risk simply did not fit their model, based upon what had gone before.From the standpoint of statistical analysis, there are many who view normal distributions of data from of hindsight from a frequentist perspective, comparing the most recent data in the context of historical averages. Therefore, the past historical record is often be seen as prologue as to what will happen in the future. This is linear thinking where scaling remains within fixed ratios. Contemplating event probabilities that are known to be distinctly nonlinear using linear thinking is apt to draw erroneous conclusions, because the underlying forces are differently scalable from what we experienced in the past.Within my lifetime we have gone from mechanical calculators to cloud-based supercomputers, with results in computational capacity and productivity that could not have been imagined 60 or 70 years ago. We are doing business in ways that were inconceivable and unattainable only a few decades ago, using instantaneous worldwide communications that accelerate the size and pace of commercial and financial transactions in real time and ways that far exceed our collective abilities to design and manage them. By virtue of our enhanced technologies, we have opened the door to effects of scale that could not have been contemplated when the institutions we created to manage the forerunners of those now-enhanced processes were created. We are figuratively 'the sorcerer's apprentice', playing with magic, using those newfound powers in ways that we can only guess at learning how to control, and which could do us all great harm if misused.Philosopher, teacher, writer (and former stock trader) Naseem Nicholas Taleb coined the phrase ‘Black Swan’ to describe those extremely rare events that for most purposes are ignored. In a power law distribution, the probability that an event will occur is proportional to its size raised to a negative exponent. The size of the power law’s exponent determines the likelihood and size of large events, meaning that the probability that the event will occur is inverse to its size; when the exponent equals 2, the probability of that event is proportional to the square of its size. For exponents of 2 or less, a power law distribution lacks a well-defined mean. The mean of data drawn from a power law distribution with an exponent of 1.5 never converges; it simply increases without limit. Thus, the larger the event, the less likely it is to occur; but if it does occur, the potential size of the event can be catastrophic. Decreasing frequency is coupled with exponentially larger magnitude of effect, with the obvious corollary that building robustness into the enterprise is a practical necessity. And yet, in the years since the debacle of 2008, what we have seen is increasing pressure to allow those who were responsible for the near collapse of the world economy, to behave much the same as they did before. Models such as those described above are supposed to be teaching tools; but apparently those who were in charge before have learned nothing from the event since then.Time and space do not allow for a broader exposition of Professor Page’s excellent analysis; but if the crisp and well-reasoned presentation he makes in his discussion of the effect of power laws on the probability of real-world events is to be taken at face value, the balance of his book is equally well done.Nevertheless, as with any work of substantial size and effort, the sheer weight of the output, inevitably leave patches here and there that would warrant reappraisal and updating in a future edition of this extraordinary book. Two points come to mind: in discussing Game Theory in chapter 21, Professor page does not elaborate on what competition between an established business firm and a new competitor seeking entry into the market would look like. This competition depends upon the ability of the competitors to differentiate themselves, in accordance with customer preferences, and which can be any of the following –• Price/price competition.• Price/quality competition.• Price/services.• Quality versus service, with price a dealbreaker.I cannot recommend Professor Page’s book too highly. If I could, I would tuck it into the book bag of every STEM student in high school and college undergraduate. I would also recommend it highly for students who do not have plans that include cultivating prowess in mathematics and science. In point of fact, I would use whatever strategy I could conjure up to induce non-science students to learn as much as they can from what Professor Page provides in his teaching syllabus. This material should be part of every high school curriculum, and educators owe it to their students and their parents to make this information, in some form, available to their students, because without it those students will be treading water getting nowhere, as the world they live in becomes overrun with data they are unable to use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"I am giving this book five stars for the effort involved in wrtiing the book, .subtracting two stars for the double marketing hype in the titile and on the back; for a net rating of three stars. The hype is explained below.1. The book started as an introduction to modeling for social scientists. It achieves that goal. But an appropriate title  would ""An Introductory Handbook on Modeling for Social Scientists"".  That could be a five star book. Instead the marketing hypes at Basic Books introduced the buzz words ""Model Thinker"" and ""data"". Both topics are lightly treated in the book. Model thinking is all the rage because of the Charles Munger quotation of chapter one. But Munger's mental models are subtle and are rarely discussed well. An excellent treatment though is Peter Bevelin's  ""Seeking Wisdom from Darwin to Munger"". Using models to make data analysis possible is professionally described in Philipp Janert's  ""Data Analysis with Open Source Tools"".2. Turning now to the issues with the content of the book.  The book contains some twenty-five models in brief chapters averaging roughly 12 pages each. A wine tasting for models. What do you when you need a full case of vintage modeling for real world problem. You turn to the references where you may find a dedicated tome with a few hundred pages covering the same topic. Two examples are Ch. 10 on Network Models backed up by Mark Newman's treatise  and Ch 18 System Dynamics Models backed up by John Sterman's ""Business Dynamics "" Now these are two worthy books, and each could justify a year's course work, representing a large number of hours of effort. This brings me to the point of how much effort is required for each of the twenty-five models for a reasonable competence level to support a truly multi-model effort. Page touches this only lightly and not well.3. This introduces the subject of a major lack of the book: a methodology for integrating a set of models for a multi-modeling effort. A methodology is a theortetical system supporting the use of a set of methods, models in a field. A methodology can also guide the effort of additional learnings in a field to support a large application.  Fortunately the British have provided five decades of work on methodologies for wicked and messy problems in social systems. An entry into this literatue is provided by ""Rational Analysis for a Problematic World: Problem Structuring Methods ..."" edited by Jonathan Rosenhead and John Mingers, 2001. Note that the British cybernetics and soft system methodology schools treat social systems as human activity systems (HAS). Over decades this has proven to be powerful and fruitful approach.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"I'm just an undergraduate computer science student (so take this review with a healthy dose of scepticism), but this is an excellent book on modelling both natural and social phenomena. Its philosophy is to use multiple models to describe a phenomena that the reader is interested in. The author discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and the strengths and weaknesses of modelling in general.The author discusses rational and psychological models, the bell curve and power law distributions, linear regression, concave and convex functions, network models, entropy, epidemiological models, Markov chains, path dependence, and many other useful mathematical tools. The author acknowledges the weaknesses of models and does a great job giving a nuanced discussion of employing models with a healthy dose of scepticism and with value judgement. The book ends with an investigation into income inequality and opioids with a ""many-model"" approach and the author shows how the use of multiple models can be helpful when trying to understand something.I suppose that my only criticisms is that the author quotes authorities to bolster the usefulness of the model that they will discuss (personally, I think that it's better to quote authorities to disagree with them). Furthermore, I feel that the mathematical rigour is a bit lacking (though I do acknowledge that this book was written for people who don't necessarily have a strong maths background).Overall, I'd rate this book like a 4.3/5 stars. Amazing primer!",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"What's a model? How to use a model? Why to use a model? Any qualitative approach to apply a model? Only use 1 model or various? These are the questions that these book look to help to answer. It is fascinating as depending your area of expertise some model will be recognizable and others not. Maybe someone can say that many other models are not included, or not clear the difference what a model is, is the Standard Atomic model a ""model""? Not described here however it is. Same with many others. In any case it is very informative and overeating to understand the why: the more diverse approach to think about a problem, the better answers or guidelines you can get. Some are most difficult to apply unless further study or practice like bandit models or NK models in my case. What about machine learning? Algorithms are also a model? It is a super interesting book to start this thinking approach, and I recommend to do also his course in Coursera: Model Thinking. Ideally to read paired with Algorithms to Live by: different style, different Algorithms (or model?)

"In our era of voluminous data modeling is increasingly used to analyze and predict.  In ""The Model Thinker,"" author Scott Page takes the reader on a tour of some of the most common models used today, using examples that touch on areas such as world affairs and geopolitics, social networking, medicine, politics, sports, economics, and unusual occurrences. The author realizes and notes that no model is perfect, so he stresses the practice of using multiple models for any given problem in order to look at situations from different angles to obtain the best solution.The general reader will likely be familiar with many of the concepts used to illustrate the models such as game theory and bell-shaped normal distributions, and while the equations highlighted will likely be over the heads of those without undergrad math degrees, general readers will be able to follow Page's arguments and train of thought well enough to make ""The Model Thinker"" a worthwhile and informative read about the modeling process used to make more and more predictions and decisions in our time.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You
"First of all, I bought this book thinking it was about far more complex models. I even have a hard time thinking of the models covered in this book as models, but rather as formulas, and mostly short ones at that. I did a little research and sure enough they are. A lot of work went into this book and it covers a lot of territory. Page warns us that most, if not all, of the formulas, excuse me, models, look at their subjects at a surface level and require a good deal more complexity to be really helpful. Instead, he recommends multi-modeling to gain more perspective. In other words, one over- simplified model isn’t as good as many over-simplified models. I’m not so sure. I think his most valuable advice is to use the modelling process as a step in the decision-making process, producing information that can inform a thoughtful decision making exercise. My experience is that this is true even with complex models. I know that game theory is very popular, but I found the discussion, not because of Page, to leave me wondering about their real value. I think the chapter on auctions could have been left out. The motivations of bidders, and sometimes those that hold auctions, is so complex that, in my opinion, it defies modelling.",4.0 out of 5 stars,The Model Thinker: What You Need to Know to Make Data Work for You

"Overall it’s an interesting book on how not to rely on a single model but multiple models during analysis. The book is a primer on data science providing multiple techniques to analyse your data.Some parts felt repetitive while others felt like the author stepped outside his expertise. For example his view on financial bailout. The author argued that allowing AIG and other big banks to fail would be catastrophic while allowing Lehman wouldn’t. Has it occurred to him that Hank Paulson the architect behind the bailout was ex Goldman and was it coincidental that Merrill, Bear Stearns and Lehman, Goldman competitors would be allowed to fail? Also, regarding AIG profitable investment, isn’t it odd that a supposedly government profitable investment also reported losses and hasn’t met expectations ever since?

"Nelson is a private consultant who has worked on countless practical problems in reliability from his consulting practice and previous employment at General Electric. He is an excellent lecturer and writer. His earlier book ""Applied Life Data Analysis"" was considered to be one of the best texts on reliability.This book is very thorough in its treatment of all aspects of accelerated testing and is filled with many good references. Nelson carefully defines the mathematical models which consist of two components, (1) an acceleration function which describes how the mean lifetime changes as a function of the acceleration factor and (2) a probability distribution that explains the random variability of outcomes at each acceleration factor. A particular mean function could be the Arrhenius relationship and the probability distribution could be exponential. Hence there is not a single Arrhenius acceleration model but rather an Arrhenius-exponential, an Arrhenius-lognormal or an Arrhenius-Weibull model. The book is filled with interesting theory and examples. Nelson provides excellent practical guidance based on his wealth of experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Accelerated Testing: Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)"

"Others have have already said that this book is superb and I completely agree.  If you have had a class that covers applied statistics (basic correlation and regression) you should be able to pick this up and read it with no trouble.  There is math here but is is *well* explained and the algebra is always presented with a worked example.The code at UCLA (sorry they will not let me post the link here) makes the incredibly good writing even more valuable because, not only will you understand the concepts behind Mixed Effects/Hierarchical Linear Models, you will be able to implement the ideas.  If you already have some experience with Mixed Effects/HLM browse the code and you will quickly see this book covers a wide scope.  I have worked with the SAS code a lot and even though the book is a bit old (by a programmer's standards) the code still works just fine.While the book is written to be clear for non-mathemeticians, there are many ""intermediate to advanced"" statistical topics covered here.  These are importantly areas which are typically unintelligible to non-statisticians or are glossed over or ignored by other authors.  Here are some noteworthy examples.  This book could/should be used as a text on data exploration and visualization.  There are many case-studies throughout the book and they all begin with great visualizations (with the all important code supplements showing the novice how to make the plots in the book).  Topics like fitting lines, splines, curves are covered clearly and are shown beautifully.  The discussion on choosing between sets of models using deviance (-2log likelihood) and AIC has the best coverage of any book.  The general discussion of likelihood estimation (maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood) is superb.  The coverage of data transformation for model fitting is explained well and is presented with wonderful plots.  These ""bonus"" topics are interwoven into the great explanations of longitudinal data analyzes.There is so much to like in this book and nothing to criticize (except perhaps the price).  It makes the rest of the books in the field look bad.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis: Modeling Change and Event Occurrence
"As someone with familiarity with statistical analyses (regression, logistic regression), looking to get stepped through longitudinal data analysis (meaning basically growth curve modelling & event occurrence) this is an excellent text, and steps you through from basics upwards.

It is divided into two main sections -- one on longitudinal analysis per se, and another on time-to-event, or survival analysis, models.

This is a book for beginners in the sense that it emphasizes data analysis, rather than theory.  But every statistician, and every user of statistics, can find something of value.

"Why do you analyze data? Why do you run a regression? Why do you build a model?Is it to make better predictions under the assumption that the future will be the same as the past, or is it to understand the causes of current phenomena (whether the data source is experiments or observations) and answer what-if (business) questions? If your intellectual curiosity pushes your mind more toward the second question, this is the book that you will thank yourself for deciding to read.On top of that, do you want to see how to apply a causal-behavioral framework to a business question? Sometimes, don't you wish there was a way not to overlay that famous normal distribution data assumption onto your work but to use your data as it is? What about learning a solution when your testing unit and test executable unit are different? And wouldn't it be cool to get a clear roadmap to locate experiments (tests) in the journey of causal inference combined with a behavioral analytics approach? The list of useful information and ideas you can get from this book can go on and on, and these are just a few examples.You will find that the author did an excellent job of presenting not-easily understandable concepts in a reader-friendly way. Additionally, you will also see that the author shares a lot of useful practical tips that must have come only from real working experiences and kindly answers the very questions readers may already have in the book.

As someone working in research and experimentation, but with no background in behavioral analysis nor R or Python - I had a lot to learn and was a little worried I'd be overwhelmed quickly. Instead, I was able to follow along, even smiling at a few of the analogies thrown in along the way to help keep me entertained.Well worth the purchase and the read. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Behavioral Data Analysis with R and Python: Customer-Driven Data for Real Business Results
"This book is a fantastic resource for those in the field who are interested in causation and robust data analysis. Speaking as a Sr. Data Scientist, I found nearly every page of this book both approachable and relevant. I've recommended it to virtually everyone on my team and in some sense I think it should be required reading for the role.Regarding the delivery of the content, Buisson strikes a healthy balance between rigor and accessibility that I think will cater to a large audience in the field. There is some math but it's not a textbook and the intuition is always clear. Regarding the content itself I almost cannot speak highly enough. In terms of causal inference, many books cover DAGs, chains, colliders, the backdoor criterion etc. but few provide a sensible framework for how to actually go about constructing these DAGs in a given context. Buisson does just this and the end result feels highly tractable (in lieu of some gigantic DAG where there is a cause to everything). Other chapters that I found highly relevant covered bootstrapping, all things experiments, moderation (interaction) and mediation (instrumental variables). All of which I have already found helpful in my actual day to day as data scientist.There are many topics this book does not cover, so do not go in thinking this is a one stop shop. But perhaps the best feature of this book is the content that Buisson does cover that appears absent in so many others. Buisson is an applied scientist and this experience shines through brightly. If you are in the field and you're not just building black box models (cool if you are but you'll know if this is not you) then you might just love this book.Books to pair this with: Anything by Angrist and Pischke.

"As a longtime fan of Monty Python, I was thrilled to get my hands on the 4K Ultra HD version of ""The Meaning of Life"". And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.First of all, the picture quality is outstanding. The vibrant colors and crisp details bring the absurdity of Monty Python's humor to life in a way that I've never seen before. Every scene, from the gross-out ""Mr. Creosote"" sketch to the bizarre ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" musical number, looks like it was shot yesterday.But the real star of the show is, of course, the comedy. ""The Meaning of Life"" is a series of sketches that explore everything from birth to death, with plenty of detours along the way. There are moments of biting satire, ridiculous slapstick, and even some surprisingly touching moments.As always, the Python troupe is on top form. The late Graham Chapman is particularly memorable as the host of the ""Galaxy Song"" sequence, while John Cleese delivers one of the funniest speeches in the history of cinema as the pompous headmaster in the ""Live Organ Transplants"" sketch.Of course, this being Monty Python, the humor isn't for everyone. If you're easily offended or put off by crude jokes and irreverent humor, ""The Meaning of Life"" probably isn't for you. But if you're a fan of absurdist comedy and British humor, you owe it to yourself to check this out.Overall, I can't recommend ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" on 4K Ultra HD enough. Whether you're a die-hard Python fan or just looking for a good laugh, this is one movie that's sure to leave you in stitches.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life

"...a Python fan since about twelve, I vividly remember this film coming out when I was thirteen or so.  I loved it.  It's great that it has not only held up but, like fine wine, it has gotten better with age.  Maybe Terry Gilliam's right when he says, in one of the commentaries, that, today, comedy's standard is so low that ""our crap seems good no.""  But it reveals their genius in so many ways.  It reveals a confidence they clearly didn't feel--as tho' they'd gotten their sea legs--in the first two efforts.  Though ""Brian"" is their supreme achievement, I have to say that this film must be placed ahead of ""Holy Grail""--which given its budget looks distincly like badly shot TV.  Hysterically funny, but the budget limits are are even more glaring in a high res medium like DVD.In ""Meaning of Life"" the entire cast are masters of the medium (something Cleese proved independently in ""A Fish Called Wanda"") and they use their skills, rising even to lyrical heights (Eric Idle's paen to the universe in ""Live Organ Transplants"").  And the effects are more hysterical twenty years later.This movie is also remarkable for the rather bitter satire of American pop culture.  Heretofore, the Python's had stayed within the classic tradition of British comedy--filled with whimsy and just plain silliness and the class structure.  American humor is generally either observational or political--and these days it almost entirely the latter.  Even the masters of observation, Goldberg and Carlin, have abandoned it for bitter political diatribes attacking former fans like myself in the basest terms because out political beliefs differ.And it follows, as it should, that the movie's best skits are the ones true to their tradition.  George Harrison once called Python the continuation of the Beatles (to the point of chipping in $8M for distribution and advertising for ""Brian""!).  And, especially in the all too brief Gilliam animations, this is completely accurate.  Without being at all derivative, they capture the whimisical sensibility the Beatles had updated and transformed and ran with it.One draw back is the rather low-rent 5.1 remix.  I've other films--e.g. the Godfather films--which are older than have far better jobs.  So don't expect much.  In fact, you might even consider using the 2CH option as the remixing engineer makes little use of the rear speakers.That gentle bitch aside, the deleted scenes are mixed (why on Earth Jones thought anyone would want to see more of Mr. Creosote is beyond me?) and clearly wisely hit the cutting room floor (especially the horrendously unfunny Martin Luther skit), but some the commentary by Jones and Gilliam--clearly done at different times and mixed--is interesting most especially for the bitterness of Gilliam's attitude.  It has been so on the two preceding films, but it's much more intense on this one.The brief interview segments shows the group rivalry is still a hot issue in the guys' psyches, nearly twenty years after Graham Chapman's tragic death ended the group; they are still bickering.  Gilliam's comments about Cleese are particularly acid; Cleese does he usual job of insulting nearly everyone.  He is returned the favor by the rest of the group, tho' Jones slyly does it with the most class and thus does it the best.  Cleese, after all, easily slips into insufferable.  Hence his brilliance as Basil Fawlty.A reluctant four star due only to the ****-poor 5.1 remix.  The studio, surprise, surprise, didn't want to spend any extra money getting a good one.The movie itself: 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life
"""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film from the iconic comedy troupe Monty Python. The film is a series of skits and musical numbers that satirize various aspects of life and society, such as religion, sex, and death. The film is divided into seven segments, each dealing with a different stage of life.The humor in the film is irreverent, absurd, and often tasteless, but it is also clever, witty and highly original. The film features some of Monty Python's most memorable sketches, such as the ""Fish slap dance"" and the ""Catholic schoolboys"" skit. The musical numbers are also noteworthy, including the catchy ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" and ""The Galaxy Song.""The Meaning of Life is a film that is not for everyone, as it is not afraid to push boundaries and tackle taboo subjects. But for fans of Monty Python and for those who enjoy offbeat and unconventional comedy, it is a must-see. It is a movie that will make you laugh, think and question the meaning of life in a hilarious and irreverent way.Overall, ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film that has stood the test of time. It's a perfect blend of absurdity, satire and wit that will leave you in stitches and questioning the meaning of life itself.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life

"I love this movie, and I have it on multiple formats. It's a vast improvement from VHS, but so was the DVD in its latest anniversary release. Don't expect a much better picture on the 4k release. The sound is  gonna be where most of the improvement is, if anything. I'd say the highest you should go on this movie is Blu Ray unless they release a version of the movie where they really sharpen the blur of some of the scenes, if that's even possible.It's similar to how the early Indiana Jones movies look... Blurry in some scenes and adequate in others, but never mind blowingly crisp, which, if I'm gonna bust the coin for the 4k UHD format, I do expect to be visibly impressed.This release, in that aspect, just felt a bit lazy, sadly.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's Meaning of Life

"Although this wasn't a standout in terms of originality, I still give it a high rating because it is so imaginative. Imagine - Americans and Russians actually working together (as in, on the same team) on something (wow)! Something like this will probably only happen in far-fetched movies like this one. We (Americans) competed with them with the Moon landings, we were at war with them (for world dominance) for almost half a century, and now we are at war with them again for (supposedly) meddling in our elections. I find it somewhat sad to realize (as this movie made me think about) that it probably would take something very out of left field (like trying to capture an 85-foot snake) to unite the US and Russia in a common noble cause. Nonetheless it was interesting to explore the idea that, maybe someday, the two countries can unite and fight for a common cause.Hopefully that won't involve going after mega-giant snakes, though!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python 2
"First thoughts...Nicely done. But...not as good as the first one. Here's the breakdown.1.  Directing--Very good. I liked the kind of quick-cut filmmaking from Lee McConnell.2.  Script--Good writing from Jeff Rank. There is some cheesy dialogue, but it's not that bad.3.  Acting--You've got William Zabka back, and he's my favorite character in this movie and the first one.Now for the content review.Rated R for language and creature violence.1.  Sex/Nudity=0/10.2.  Violence/Gore=4/10. It's not as violent as the first one but the snakes still eat quite a few people.3.  Language=8/10.

"I bought this film on Amazon with the first Python and bought blindly. This film is not really bad as it is boring. The movie is about a plane crashing somewhat close to the first one. I watched this right after I watched the first Python and was disappointed. The cast of the film is nowhere close as good as the first one with Billy Zabka returning in it(this time a bad guy) but still the same charecter as the first one. The two main good guys are played by Dana Ashbrook and Simmone Jade McKinnon. If you do not watch Syfy original movies or direct to DVD films you will not know who these people are but since I watch b movies I know who they are. Once again the cast fails in bad acting and no name actors.The films CGI is a little better than the first one but CGI no matter what the budget is the CGI gets better by the year and this being made two years later than the first one. With the first one it kept me in it and I was not bored but this one is very boring and kept me looking at the time on the DVD player for how much time is left. That is the negative of the film and here goes the positive: the attacks or somewhat good and that's about it. I paid $5 for it and wished I bought another DVD but I originally bought this because I bought Boa vs Python in a 4 film collection and decided to collect the whole series including Boa, Python, and this film which I have completed.My advice do not buy or do not rent on Netflix unless you want to be bored.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python 2
"Big snake in a little box.  They are sent to retrieve a monstrous python (military experiment) that seemed to have been contained in a little box.  The CGI is what one would expect from a low budget movie.  The movie is entertaining, but there are a lot of plot holes.  For instance, the woman has been blinded, but she is the only one who can fit in the ventilation duct so naturally they give her a flashlight.  And once out of the vent, she is running around fine.  The snake growls, roars and hisses, but actually the less one sees of the snake, the better.  And suddenly there are more than one snake.  The ending just seemed to be an excuse to use lots and lots of GCI explosions.  Nothing special about the movie, which takes place mainly at the base where the snake box is taken after the plane carrying it crashed.  And naturally, told not to open the box, they have to open the box.  Bad idea.  Remarkably tame for this type of movie, without copious gallons of blood.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python 2

"i don't think it has to be so challenging to learn functional programming. The examples given assume you have  background in higher level math or other areas that are not necessarily for a laymen. I don't think i should have to get my math book out in order to understand the example of how mutability works. Do I need to know how nuclear fission works in order to be able to run on a lightbulb? If I am trying to turn on the light and the example that is given is based on nuclear fission (and it is assumed that I know that).. won't it make it challenging for me to get the concept. I have a background in Scala and I was able to learn functional programming much easier from mark lewis.. where I did not have to get all my books from undergrad out, just to be able to grasp the concept. I guess things are just easier these days, for example I have data engineers working for me doing machine learning, and they are leveraging the ml libraries to get it done, without having the background in statistics. When I speak to them and I take them into the deep dive, they get lost, but the results that are produced are just as impactful. In summary, it is my opinion, that if you have your math books, and a dictionary... and can get through the examples presented, then you might actually get to what is trying to be taught... If not... then you will be posting a review that says ""this is a good book and a great way to start to learn functional programming in python"" while you kind of chalk up the 22 bucks you wasted buying this encyclopedia to put on your shelf, while you find something that is easier to understand with simple examples, written in laymen's terms.

"The author clearly knows their stuff, and covered a wealth of great patterns in Python and how to use higher order functions and built-ins to write more composable and maintainable code. That being said, I do not recommend this for a first introduction to functional programming. The book is very large and spread out, so the useful nuggets of FP may be hard to discern for a newbie. It may even dissuade some people from using FP as the rationale is not clearly explained as to how to better use FP practices. However, if you're familiar with FP already, this book does a good job in explaining how Python tackles functional code.I do think the book got bloated at times, as three chapters are pretty much dedicated to itertools and functools (Which are super useful and the author does a good job explaining when to use them), but it mostly rehashed what's available on standard docs. However, I did appreciate the introduction of other libraries in the book to make code more functional.There are examples at the end of each chapter, which I'm always a fan of, and they seemed thoughtful and relevant to the discussion at hand.If the author ever goes for a 2nd edition, I recommend streamlining the book to be more focused and emphasizing the benefits of FP more up-front throughout the book. Also, an appendix with selected answers to exercises annotated with FP benefits would be a great addition.Disclosure: I was provided an early review copy from the publisher and was asked to review this work.

"The book Functional Python Programming is a comprehensive text that examines, illustrates, and discusses functional programming using the Python programming language. Python is an object-oriented language but can be used functionally in the paradigm of functional programming.The book is organized into sixteen chapters, starting from the fundamentals of functional programming, and functions, and then concludes applied functional programming with several applications.The book has approximately four sections yet not of consistent size in chapters. The first two chapters are an introduction, laying the foundation. The second, next section is five chapters that build more complex topics with higher-order functions, recursion, and stateless objects. The third section examines various modules for use in functional programming in Python. The fourth section is an example of applications using functional programming in Python.Functional programming is an area where such languages as LISP and Scala reign supreme, but the difficulty is learning a new paradigm of thought whilst learning the nuances and syntax of another programming language. This process can be and is frustrating and disillusioning for a learner. This is why functional programming in Python is a very helpful book. In the second part of the learning process, the programming language is alleviated by using the Python programming language.The book examines and demonstrates using functional programming with Python in applications that are natural for functional programming: recursion, combinations, permutation, and computing the chi-square value. Some not-so-obvious applications are web services, multiprocessing, concurrency, and threading. The book covers a wide variety of topics and subjects.The book goes immediately into functional programming, the concepts, and functions as first-class objects in Python. Then the material goes to iterators, generators, and functional approaches in applying them. From there the book goes into working functionally with collections, and data structures. Higher-order functions used in functional programming are examined with functional mapping and filters. Lambda or anonymous functions are examined and Python lambda functions illustrate the concept.The book continues with recursion and recursive functions, and then into complex stateless objects in Python. Then several modules relating to functional programming are examined--itertools, functools, and pymonad. The functional programming then examines applications such as process threads, concurrency, web services, and statistical chi-squared values.Overall the book is an excellent source and reference for functional programming using the Python programming language. The text is comprehensive in scope from the basic foundation of functional programming, functions as first-class objects, modules for functional programming, and then applications of Python using functional programming. The Python source code is provided, illustrative, and available for download. Hence a reader can immediately run the example Python source code, tinker with it, and learn by doing.A problem is ""all over the place"" covering many a topic to illustrate functional programming but going from multi-processing and concurrency to web services, to the measure of statistical randomness chi-squared. The book is illustrative yet is incoherent coverage of different topics around functional programming with Python.There is an implicit requirement--knowledge and some skill with the Python programming language and environment. This book is not suited to learning Python, but to learning functional programming, Python modules, and Python functionality.The book Functional Python Programming is an excellent tool for Python software developers to take their skills to the next level and another paradigm of thinking--the functional programming paradigm. The comprehensive nature of the book makes it an excellent book to learn and as a reference going forward. However, the vastness of the material and the different paradigms of functional programming are not for a newbie learning Python.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Functional Python Programming: Use a functional approach to write succinct, expressive, and efficient Python code, 3rd Edition"

"The book address ways that the benefits of functional programming accrue when we use these design patterns to build Python applications. It delves into the central features of the functional programming paradigm. It shows how to leverage immutable Python objects and how generator expressions adapt functional programming concepts to the Python language. It shows how you can use several built-in Python functions to operate on collections of data. This chapter will focus on several relatively simple functions, such as any() and all(), which reduce a collection of values to a single result. It examines the commonly used higher-order functions such as map() and filter(). It also shows many other higher-order functions and how we can create functions that work with or return functions.The book teaches how to design an algorithm using recursion and then optimize it into a high-performance for a loop. We’ll also look at other widely used reductions, including collections. It showcases many ways that we can use immutable tuples, and typing. NamedTuple, and the frozen @dataclass instead of stateful objects. It examines several functions in the itertools standard library module. This collection of functions simplifies writing programs that deal with collections or generator functions. It covers the combinatoric functions in the itertools module. It focuses on how to use some of the functions in the functools module for functional programming. It covers the toolz package and a number of closely related modules that help us write functional programs in Python. The toolz modules parallel the built-in itertools and functools modules, providing alternatives that are often more sophisticated and make better use of curried functions.Finally, the book covers how we can look at a decorator as a way to build a composite function. While there is considerable flexibility here, there are also some conceptual limitations. It examines some of the features of the PyMonad library. The futures modules point out an essential consequence of good functional design: we can distribute the processing workload. Using immutable objects means that we can’t corrupt an object because of poorly synchronized write operations.In the end, the book shows how we can think of web services as a nested collection of functions that transform a request into a reply. We’ll see ways to leverage functional programming concepts for building responsive, dynamic web content.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Functional Python Programming: Use a functional approach to write succinct, expressive, and efficient Python code, 3rd Edition"

Dr. Mark Fenner's ""Machine learning with Python for Everyone"" is high quality, practical, and educational.The author's preface describes the intended audience.  ""I've written 'Machine Learning with Python for Everyone' for the absolute beginner to machine learning.  Even more so, you may well have little college-level mathematics in your toolbox and I'm not going to try to change that.  While many machine learning books are very heavy on mathematical concepts and equations, I've done my best to minimize the amount of mathematical luggage you'll have to carry.  I do expect, given the book's title, that you'll have some basis proficiency in Python.  If you can read Python, you'll be able to get a lot more out of our discussions.  While many books on machine learning rely on mathematics, I'm relying on stories, pictures, and Python code to communicate with you.""Please read the Table of Contents and introductory material, accessible though the 'Look Inside' feature on the book's Amazon page.Throughout the book, the material is clearly presented and requires no previous introduction to machine learning.  That said, while there are no mathematical proofs, and there is some mathematical notation, the reader will need to be comfortable with charts, graphs, and mathematical concepts and terminology.Dr. Fenner covers machine learning from the perspective of developing predictive machine learning models.  He discusses many techniques for developing classification and regression models using well chosen examples and explanations.  His writing style is informal and enjoyable.While this is not a workbook with many listings of ready-to-run machine learning projects, it does include many short examples, written in well-formed Python 3, illustrating concepts and techniques.I highly recommend this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
Mark is a wonderful writer and he is able to simplify a topic as complex as machine learning and turn it into an easy to understand presentation. This is easily the best survey of machine learning I have seen. Having well thought out exercises and examples that anyone can run on their home computer makes this book even more valuable. Highly recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
"The title led me to believe that it would be a complete tutorial including how to set up an environment to use the examples in the book. Unless I'm missing something the book depends on the reader being familiar with juypter and has the time and energy to enter a fairly large python module by hand from the appendix. The text and examples seem interesting but I didn't have the time to enter the required python module. And I'd prefer running the examples instead of taking the author's word that they work as described. I was able to return the book but I'm had high hopes that ""Everyone"" included me.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
"I really appreciated Mark's approach to the ever present stack/tool chain issue that stands as a stumbling block to people getting started.  The information is relevant, up to date and approaches many of the same data science/ML hello world type scenarios with a very deep functional perspective.  To go further, I had a question about one of the external libraries... reached out to Mark, and was immediately provided a response.  I highly recommend this text.Sean O'Brien",5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
The book was very well written. It was easy to follow and I was able to understand various concepts without going through a hard time.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Machine Learning with Python for Everyone (Addison-Wesley Data & Analytics Series)
I found the topics in this book to be fascinating which is why I picked it up and was hopeful that a self taught developer would be able to find some use for this book. To which I have found some nuggets of helpful tips. It broke down bit shifting in a pretty digestible manner.However with all the above said I found the book very disorganized. For example in chapter one the purpose was on the discussion about small problems. We go straight into the fibonacci sequence (which did give some very helpful hints on recursion) but then right after talking about that we go straight into memoization without any segue. Then after that we go right into trivial compression then after 4 to 4 1/2 pages we go right into unbreakable encryption. With each change in topic I was left with trying to figure out what the author wanted me to gain and how did those specifically classify as small problems.I gave it a 3 because this book does have some very cool insights and taking the examples and making them my own has helped but for someone without a CS degree I was left wanting more depth and that is something that I didn't get.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python
This book is great for semi-experienced python users. Every chapter introduces several new pythonic concepts and provides a very nice generic framework for trying out the algorithms described. It is the kind of book where you'd get the most out of it when you work through it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python
"This book is ok.  It would have been better if it were not for the author's decision to use type hints in all the examples.  Typing hints are relatively new, and if you just learned python and are looking to get a little more classic computer science knowledge, they only get in the way.  Not that type hints are hard to understand, it just clutters up the code if you are not concerned about production, only illustrating concepts the reader is trying to learn.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python

"I’ve played around considerably with neural networks (as a student) and used TensorFlow to implement them, but it was really cool to see one implemented entirely in Python. It allowed me to play around and inspect the neurons and weights, etc. That was a really helpful set of exercises to not just “learn” about them, but to actually watch one in action.This book is supported by a community with active participation from the author, so you really get a lot more than just a book.  Highly reccomended.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python
"I particularly like the way Professor Kopec organized the topics, code and explanations.  Although the book lacks complexity analysis, it is an excellent book for someone who is picking up Python and reviewing CS topics at the same time.  The topics selected by Professor Kopec aren't the same as those you would find in a (rather boring, I should say) data structure and algorithm book where C/Java code snippets are (sometimes in brute force) translated to Python code snippets.  The topics in this book build up a repertoire of re-usable frameworks for the ""basics"" such as search, CSP,  and graph algorithms as an illustration of how generic framework can be constructed in Python to solve classes of similar problems.  In later half of the book Professor Kopec leads the reader into the AI realm of things (at the introductory level) such as neural networks and game theory.  Very enjoyable read and great learning.

"Author dives right into coding generic frameworks without first explaining a problem in depth. Explanation does follow the code but is usually quite superficial.

"I absolutely love Classic Computer Science Problems in Python. It taught me both how to use Python in ways I never had before and about some computer science concepts that I may have heard of but had never used for actual coding projects. The book presents a large amount of information in a surprisingly small number of pages. I appreciate that the description of the material is to-the-point and not mathematical. This is the only computer science book I’ve read cover-to-cover in probably ten years. It was extremely useful in working through the Advent of Code problem sets and, directly because of this book, I’ve used A*, Dijkstra’s algorithm, and genetic algorithms in projects at work. I liked Classic Computer Science Problems in Python so much that I also bought Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift to help me improve my Swift skills.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Computer Science Problems in Python
"I'm a fossil, but I have actually moved mostly to e-books.  However, I purchase this because it looks so lovely sitting in the background of my zoom calls.Not really.  Rather expensive for decoration anyway.In reality, having this book is essential because it's like reading the dictionary when I was a kid.  I go to look up albatross, but there's albedo - I word I remember hearing but never really knew what it meant.  Just as with a map it's the same object you can see from across the room as you walk towards it to checkout one town, with this Nutshell book you can an overview of the whole of Python (through 3.11) filled with references to what tools and approaches are actually viable.  If there are four different ways to do something, which makes sense to pursue?The only criticism that I have (not because there aren't omissions or certain passages I'd take issue with - but they are far outweighed by the sound approach and scholarly efficiency) is that there is no section covering what's new.  There is, for example, an entire new chapter on Type Annotations - again an example of something I might not have noticed if I was just efficiently using it as a reference to look things up.I'm happy to say I've learned a lot from this book and I'm happy that the drought between the 2nd and 3rd Editions is a fading memory.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference
"I came to this book for a quick intro, which is what the term ""in a nutshell"" means to me. I have in fact read a few ""in a nutshell"" books, and those were concise and pragmatic.This work is not that. Instead, it is an (complete as far as I can tell) REFERENCE work which guides you through the minutiae of Python - and practically core Python only. It goes really deep on all topics that it covers, sometimes annoyingly (to me) so. Just a small example to give you an idea, most ""quick start"" books just tell you Python uses indentations for blocks. This book takes 10 pages to explain the lexical structure.So it's an excellent reference for when you get stuck with some advanced code, and to learn intricacies. And it's a great learning tool, too. I frankly didn't even know about chained expressions (a<b<=c>d), or that Python had type definitions and concurrency!There are also later chapters about files, networking, and such, but it stops there. No pandas, Numpy, or machine learning to be found here! If you want to become a true expert in Python, this is the book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference
"Python in a Nutshell is an excellent book for professional developers who have some experience with Python but want to take the leap to being a senior Python developer, Python in a Nutshell is required reading.This is not a book for beginners new to programming, and I’d be hesitant to say that programmers experienced in other languages should use this book to learn Python (but if you’re the bold adventurous sort, have at it.) But if you want to fill out your Python knowledge and go beyond a developer who “kinda sorta” knows Python and copies and pastes Python code from Stack Overflow without much thought, this is a book you need to read.In a way, the title is a bit misleading. “In a nutshell” gives you the idea that this book is small, but it’s actually over 700 pages long. Rather, this book is compact: it doesn’t waste time covering the basics and is quite dense with useful information.The density of this book sometimes works against itself; there were quite a few times I had to carefully parse out the words and could have really used some example code to demonstrate the concepts. I understand why the authors skipped it: not everyone will need the additional explanation for every concept, and providing these examples would have doubled the page count. (For example, the object-oriented chapter led me to take quite a few breaks to test out what I had learned in the Python interactive shell just to make sure I understood what I read.) Suffice it to say, the information in the book is useful and accurate. It’s worth the time it sometimes takes to parse through the difficult concepts.Other times though, it’s a breeze. There’s quite a wide range of topics covered in this book, and I feel like they do a good job going deep enough into each one without losing the big picture. And quite frankly: a lot of the information in this book just plain isn’t easy to find online. Without this book, you’d be chasing endless search result links to blog posts of varying quality, all while still missing out of several topics. The real value of Python in a Nutshell is that it gathers all of this knowledge into one well-written book.Other books similar to Python in a Nutshell include Fluent Python by Luciano Ramahlo, Effective Python by Brett Slatkin, and Serious Python by Julien Danjou. I recommend reading all of these books though; while they have some overlap they complement rather than replace each other. If you’re experienced in a different language but want to learn Python, Python Distilled by David Beazley is a good book to read first for general Python information, and then followed up by Python in a Nutshell.Even as a software engineer with years of experience in Python myself, I kept finding little nuggets of information that has filled in gaps of my Python knowledge that I didn’t know I had. Again, it’s not a book for total beginners but don’t let that scare you off. As long as you have the basics of programming concepts and are generally comfortable writing Python code, go ahead and get started with Python in a Nutshell.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Python in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference

"I wanted to pick up programming as a little hobby to do in my spare time. After stumbling through countless websites picking up little tidbits of information here and there (and spending ALOT more time and effort than I expected) I was starting to doubt if this was even possible to learn myself. As said before, I would pick up little bits of information and try to make my own little programs. I got very very basic information down but couldn’t comprehend how to to write anything more than a simple 20 line script. I was about to give up. Then I bought this book.and WOW. This book was absolutely amazing. I read it for hours everyday from when I purchased it. I finished the book 3 weeks later. I can say this book was monumental in what it taught me. (And it’s size too - LOL - the thing is massive but so worth the read)He teaches everything so simple and easy to read. Go through his lines of every example and try to understand what is happening. You’ll find by about page 500 everything is slowly starting to make sense. By page 1000 you’ll be thinking wow I can read and understand each example of code (even the longer ones). You start seeing how programs are put together, how every single line has a purpose. The syntax, the wording, the placement , the white space. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed learning programming from this book. It has enabled me to complete an online python course. I love solving problems on my own - each one is like a puzzle and I get a little joy when I successfully complete the challenge. Thank you Mark - for allowing me to experience this journey. I surely would have given up had I not found this book.This book is like sitting directly in his college lectures for a semester. Only I didn’t have to spend 4 months to get the information. I could learn as fast as I could read. All told it was a 3 week book for me and it was very very very worth it. I’ve purchased his second book (Programming Python) and hope it will be just as good as this one.If you’re serious about learning python than stop looking further. This needs to be a book you buy.The contents are expansive and in depth without overloading you. It’s taught in a simple easy to understand way. And the appendix is well laid out so after you finish reading it and get into the nitty gritty of programming you can always know exactly where to look in the book to get help on how to do something.

This is an excellent book for intermediate to advanced programmers looking for a methodical deep dive into the Python programming language.If you’re just looking to get started and up and running you’re probably going to find this book overly long and far too “in the weeds” to be useful. More frankly - I would avoid this book until your actually proficient with the Python language and actually want to become an advanced developer or you will be frustrated.Most people can get by hacking away at Python without being an expert at the language.There’s a large percentage of people that will be more than helped by the standard documentation that comes with a Python distribution and that is all they will need.“Learning Python” is more of an advanced text and would perhaps be more appropriately named as “Mastering Python”.

"I don't write too many reviews but I have to review this book. I'm just trying to learn the language to do some web, security, and rasberry pi development on my own. I tried to learn python over a year ago, got frustrated and quit. I tried to pick up the language again about 2 weeks ago. I have read and tried to work through Learning Python the Hard Way (LPHW). LPHW is a good resource and it did give me a general understand of the language. It teaches python version 2x. I have also read Dive into Python 3 (DP3). DP3 is also a good resource and it teaches python version 3x. I have also read and referenced  [...] For the most part, I am able to write simple code. But I got frustrated when I tried to review and understand complex code structures. I had a hard time understanding the nuances of the language. I spent hours searching online and watching tutorial videos. But I was constantly frustrated because there were all these exceptions that didn't make sense to me. I kept on asking why this works and why that does not work.The best thing about this book is that it explain the nuances of the language by giving multiple examples. So it does explains it in a complete manner. A lot of other resources will touch upon a topic and then glance over it. I often wondered.. what about this... so a lot of other resources expect you to test the other cases out which in most circumstance will be okay, but in others, you are still left wondering ""why?"". This book does not do that. In fact, I almost didn't need to try the examples on the interactive python command line because it was so thorough.This book is not for the beginner. You will get lost among the trees in the forest because there is so much information in this book. If you are impatient or need to start coding right away, you really won't be able to do this with Learning Python. LPHW and DP3 are much better at getting you up and running. But to write error free code, you have to understand the nuances of the language which Learning Python teaches you. Learning Python the Hard Way (free on the internet) and Dive into Python 3 (also free) are great resources to get introduced to the language. I would recommend both before you delve into this book. But once you get an understand of the basics of python, this book will fill in the missing details.As a disclaimer, I have only been reading this book for a day. I have already read 300 pages. A lot of it was review. But I learned a lot of new stuff as well that filled in the gaps. I have not read the section on regex or the more advanced sections yet so this review is not complete. But so far, I am impressed on the thoroughness of the subject matter.The main grip I have is that I bought the kindle version. If I read it in a linear fashion the material seem to flow nicely. But when I come to certain sections, I need to jump around. You find this a lot with any technical book. The kindle version makes this difficult because I cannot ""easily"" keep track of what I was reading so I get side tracked a lot. I also cannot effectively add notes (yes, I know I can add notes). I ended up using 4 devices to read this book just to keep track of where I was. I may get the hardcopy so that I have an easy quick reference book to look at later at my desk. With a hard copy, I use bookmarkers that I can quickly page to. I know about the kindle bookmarks but they are cumbersome to use. Fortunately, its hard to beat the fact that I can carry this book on my phone if I wanted to. So I would rate the kindle version 3 stars.Overall, I would buy this again on kindle.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
"This is a great, thorough, quality book on Python, targeted at individuals who have some experience writing programs, but who want to learn Python to write production-grade Python programs.All the people griping about how long this book is are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes the book is long, but to effectively use a programming language, there is a lot to learn.  And this book does a great job of metering out that information.  All the people griping about how there's too many ""forward references"" to other topics, are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes there are forward references, because there MUST be.  You can't learn every topic about a language in a linear way-- it's simply not possible.  If you are the target audience of this book, then you already understand that.If you've never programmed before, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a quick get-acquainted book about Python, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a reference manual for Python, this the WRONG book.  This book does NOT claim to be any of those things.  This book is a tutorial for people who have written programs before, who want to become an expert in Python.  If that's you, then you understand that the book is necessarily long.The Python language is a somewhat ""larger"" language than ""C"" or old-school Java.  So there is a lot to cover:  ""lists"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sequences"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""dictionaries"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""tuples"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sets"" are BUILT IN to the language.  This is in contrast to the Java language or ""C"" language.  This book explains all of those BUILT INS and ""why"" they are built in.  If you aren't interested in any of that, then this is the WRONG book for you.This book also goes into detail about why the language is designed the way it is.  And it does this not only in regard to the high-level design of the language, but it does this for every nuance and detail of the language.  This is great information if your goal is to follow best practices when actually using the language for real world problems.  If you just want to write little toy programs and you don't care about best practices, then this is the WRONG book for you.The entirety of the Python ecosystem is MASSIVE, and this book goes into detail about a lot of that ecosystem.  (Although even a book of this size does not cover ALL of that ecosystem).  This includes things like:  embedding Python in a larger ""C"" application, calling ""C"" functions from Python, properties, metaclasses, decorators, Unicode, exceptions, object-oriented classes, etc., etc., etc.You think it's possible to learn all that detail, learn all the best practices of managing all those language features, and do it in a 100 page book?  Well, if you do, then you are not the target audience of this book.  People who want to learn to use Python to do production-grade programming realize that understanding all this detail takes a lot of pages, it takes patience, and it takes forward references.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
"At 65 I am ""In-Progress"" in Learning (attempting) Python. There is so much information out there on Learning and ""Using"" Python that it is very easy to become Overloaded and almost Entangled with Unexpected Results. The ""Learning Python"" book by Mark Lutz is Incredibly easy to read. Almost like a novel in some respects, where you find yourself reading one more page, one more section, one more chapter. Detail flows, and is presented in a meaningful way that you do not become exasperated with the volume. Mark lays a Path from the Start that begins with what Python is and Is Not. Then how to install, and entry to how to use. From there the Journey Begins. Learning, Experiencing, Practicing, and Acquiring the knowledge in useful bites, maybe bytes....Mark has such a Fantastic Grasp on the Python Language that he uses his skill to Be Your Guide on Your Journey to Learning and Understanding How to Use Python. Whether in a Large Program, as a student, as a hobbyist, or as an integral component of your office work. He leads you on a level, paved pathway that leaves you with a smile.  His approach is so unique, that many who suggest his work do so in the matter that it is ""The Best"". I have to agree. I am an engineer and use C++ at an Intermediate Level. But found Python to be Overall Cumbersome and with many holes and obstacles to implementation.Following from Start to Finish, my Linear Way, and probably as most will suggest more than a touch anal, none the less his Learning Python has lead me to Where I am Now Able to Construct Applications that work. Here at home, and out in the field. Mark has such a fantastic way of presenting data, descriptions and how to avoid syntax errors, that you will come to the same conclusion of the all the others; That Learning Python by Mark Lutz is the Pathway Forward.Having a Copy of the Book on my desk while going through Tutorials from Udemy and a few other On-Line Learning Sites has increased my ability to obtain and use constructively what I learn, and where to look when I am unsure. I am sure some would think of his works as a Bible, I would interject the caveat that ""Yes, but it is so Well Written and Easy to Understand"". Wars will not break out. Will maybe.

"Just as a background, I am a software developer with 15 years software development in C, C++, Perl, and some Java moving into a position working with Python for the first time.  I was looking for a good Python ""techniques"" and basic fundamental language guide book, which is why I turned to the O'Reilly line (I have so many of their other books, from Perl to UNIX tools, to Java, etc.)  But, quite frankly, this book by Mark Lutz is very difficult to recommend (skip to the end for the TL;DR).  In a short version, it is very amateur, both from a writing perspective and a software development perspective.For the long version, first the bad points...  The author is either a half-baked software developer, or he is very good at coming across as one.  Statements like ""Python is better because it doesn't have the costly compile and link-time steps that languages like C does"" makes me tilt my head in wonder.  Does he not understand that ALL program execution has to be compiled to machine code?  And that if it is not done at development time, then the user of your code will surely incur that hit at runtime through an interpreter or some virtual machine?  The reason C (and C++, although the author usually names just C) compiles into machine code ahead of time is to save the runtime cost.  This isn't a ""Python is better than C"" issue.  It's a simple tradeoff that any real software developer realizes and makes use of.  If you don't need the runtime speed, then improving development cycle speed is a good thing, yes?  And likewise if you need a fast execution, taking the hit ahead of time so your users don't is worth it.  This is software development, something the author doesn't display a good job of fully understanding.In fact, half of the book reads like this.  From subjective, baseless assertions like ""most programmers prefer single-quotes [to declare literal strings]"" (???  Certainly not in my experience!) to constant ""rah rah"" Python proselytizing over other programming languages (C is a favorite target of his), it all shows a very shaky grasp on the ins and outs of software engineering.  He slams C's memory management and ability to get to the guts of a program, yet that is often required to create a sleek, highly efficient program.  He attacks C's syntax and praises Python's indent-based syntax without addressing the fact that Python tightly binds pretty visual formatting of human-readable code to machine execution flow.  To a seasoned software engineer, this is all about tradeoffs and using the right tool for the job.  Python does MANY things well, some MUCH better than C.  It's about using a hammer on a nail and a driver on a screw.  But you will have to wade through pages of cheer-leading and preaching from the author before you learn to actually USE Python.  If you are a C developer buying this book, you'd want to get to the nuts and bolts and just figure out how to use this tool to accomplish the job.  If not, you wouldn't understand all the constant comparisons and claims of superiority over C anyway.  ""WHY Python?"" the author asks. Because it is the tool to use for this job.  It's that simple.  I don't need the immature and insecure attempts to self-rationalize why Python ""REALLY is great guys, honestly! Much better than 'C'!""  I just need to know the syntax, libraries, and tips and tricks.Now for the good:  all that latter stuff IS in here.  You just have to wade through the self-actualizing, childish ego-trip to get to the juicy bits.  So, in the end, I'd recommend it if you don't mind fighting your way through what amounts to a half-book's worth of insecurities to find the information you need.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"

"The most amazing thing about this 1500-page book is that it's incomplete without its sequel, the equally humongous ""Programming Python."" This book gives you a detailed tour of the basics of the language, its syntax and semantics and just a touch of actual useful programming. The real work, or so I gather, is in the sequel.However, this is a review of this book, not the sequel. That will come in a few months (which right there tells you I reasonably liked this book).The second most amazing thing about this book, then, is how clear it is.Python is a language both simple and complex: you can learn to write simple scripts in a day or so, but there is so much more to it. It is good for structured programming, declarative programming, and object-oriented programming (at least). It has a huge library of nice functions and widgets to add in as you need them - and that's just the official distribution.Lutz introduces us to the language without assuming anything other than that we have a computer and are able to do basic things with it (including accessing the Intartoobs). He writes in a clear and occasionally humorous style, borrowing variable names and such from Monty Python (after whom the language is named), and giving examples that actually demonstrate the points being made - though, aside from that, most of them don't actually _do_ much. (Again, that appears to be reserved for the sequel.)For someone with no programming background, this would probably be a do-able book. For someone like me who has such a background, though out of date, it's definitely right on the beam. (I picked this up because I wanted to learn a reasonably modern programming language; coworkers recommended either this or PHP, and I liked the name of this one better. Seriously...) For an advanced programmer, familiar with languages like Java and C++, it provides clear explanations of how (and occasionally why) Python is different from those languages.

"This is not a traditional eBook, it was just photocopied, pieced together [poorly] and uploaded by ??..I can see the divisions of the pieces of pages, not even merged properly. Its really a piece of junk, but gets the job done. One extremely annoying problem that you may not be able to overcome is it was assembled improperly, the 1 page shows in portrait, and then the actual reading material is in landscape. I have a rotating monitor, doesn't work, Change the monitor to landscape and the book[Kindle] reverses the view to portrait. So I just spin my monitor on its axle w/o changing the view mode so I can read the book. Forget about changing the fonts or anything, this is just some scanned pages, and not a actual eBook in any terms, so the pages are just photos ( they did not put it through a OCR to change it back into a document format to create a real eBook with real text, so you cant copy/paste any lines or adjust fonts etc.. I wanted to save some money so In that sense I did save $20 off of renting it from Pearson vs owning it for future reference; other than that after I read the whole thing for my class I will see if its actually worth keeping.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Business Intelligence, Analytics, and Data Science: A Managerial Perspective"

There are several typos but my biggest problem is that it uses acronyms and other words mid paragraph but never clarifies what they are or their importance.

"First of all, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the subtitle of the book should include the word 'Bayesian' in some form or the other. The reason this is important is because the Bayesian approach, although an important one, is not adapted across the board in machine learning, and consequently, an astonishing number of methods presented in the book (Bayesian versions of just about anything) are not mainstream. The recent Duda book gives a better idea of the mainstream in this sense, but because the field has evolved in such rapidity, it excludes massive recent developments in kernel methods and graphical models, which Bishop includes.Pedagogically, however, this book is almost uniformly excellent. I didn't like the presentation on some of the material (the first few sections on linear classification are relatively poor), but in general, Bishop does an amazing job. If you want to learn the mathematical base of most machine learning methods in a practical and reasonably rigorous way, this book is for you. Pay attention in particular to the exercises, which are the best I've seen so far in such a text; involved, but not frustrating, and always aiming to further elucidate the concepts. If you want to really learn the material presented, you should, at the very least, solve all the exercises that appear in the sections of the text (about half of the total). I've gone through almost the entire text, and done just that, so I can say that it's not as daunting as it looks. To judge your level regarding this, solve the exercises for the first two chapters (the second, a sort of crash course on probability, is quite formidable). If you can do these, you should be fine. The author has solutions for a lot of them on his website, so you can go there and check if you get stuck on some.As far as the Bayesian methods are concerned, they are usually a lot more mathematically involved than their counterparts, so solving the equations representing them can only give you more practice. Seeing the same material in a different light can never hurt you, and I learned some important statistical/mathematical concepts from the book that I'd never heard of, such as the Laplace and Evidence Approximations. Of course, if you're not interested, you can simply skip the method altogether.From the preceding, it should be clear that the book is written for a certain kind of reader in mind. It is not for people who want a quick introduction to some method without the gory details behind its mathematical machinery. There is no pseudocode. The book assumes that once you get the math, the algorithm to implement the method should either become completely clear, or in the case of some more complicated methods (SVMs for example), you know where to head for details on an implementation. Therefore, the people who will benefit most from the book are those who will either be doing research in this area, or will be implementing the methods in detail on lower level languages (such as C). I know that sounds offputting, but the good thing is that the level of the math required to understand the methods is quite low; basic probability, linear algebra and multivariable calculus. (Read the appendices in detail as well.) No knowledge is needed, for example, of measure-theoretic probability or function spaces (for kernel methods) etc. Therefore the book is accessible to most with a decent engineering background, who are willing to work through it. If you're one of the people who the book is aimed at, you should seriously consider getting it.Edited to Add:I've changed my rating from 4 stars to 5. Even now, 4-5 years later, there is simply no good substitute for this book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"Usually considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence, especially at the present time, pattern recognition is defined in this book as the automatic discovery of regularities in data by the use of computer algorithms and the use of these regularities for classifying the data in different categories. The first part of this definition is typically referred to as `unsupervised learning' and the latter `supervised learning.' Both of these areas have resulted in a gargantuan amount of research due to their importance in areas such as medicine, genomics, network modeling, financial engineering, and voice recognition. This book emphasizes a ""conceptual"" approach to teaching pattern recognition, and therefore is highly valuable to those who need to learn the subject. Too often this field is taught purely from the formal standpoint, or conversely by the use of many trivial examples that illustrate the algorithms that are used. These approaches make the subject appear to be either a highly-developed mathematical one (which it is) or a cookbook that does not have a sound foundation. This book is one of the few that will allow the reader to gain a more in-depth understanding and appreciation of the subject as preparation for doing research and development in pattern recognition. The author claims that the book is self-contained as far as background in probability theory is concerned, but readers should still be prepared with this background in order to better appreciate the content. The Bayesian paradigm dominates the book, as it should given the current emphasis in research circles.Some of the highlights of the book include discussions on:* Relative entropy and mutual information. These two concepts have become very important in recent years, especially in the validation of pattern recognition models, the selection of relevant variables, and in independent component analysis.* Periodic variables and how they can be used in contexts where Gaussian distributions are problematic.* Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, especially the role of the detailed balance condition in obtaining the acceptance probability for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.* Bayesian linear regression and its ability to deal with the over-fitting problem in calculations of maximum likelihood and the determination of model complexity.* Kernel learning (usually called support vector machines in other books).Some of the minuses of the book include:* Needs more in-depth discussion of Bayesian neural networks, over and above what is done in the book. The author's does devote a section in the book to this topic, but given its enormous importance, especially in automated learning and economic forecasting, more examples need to be included.* More real-world test cases need to be included, along with a comparison of the efficacies of different approaches, so as to illustrate the ""no free lunch"" philosophy.* More exercises that require more analysis on part of the reader, instead of derivation-type problems or straightforward numerical exercises.* Needs more details on independent component analysis. Only a few paragraphs are devoted to this important topic.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I recently had to quickly understand some facts about the probabilistic interpretation of pca. Naturally I picked up this book and it didn't disappoint. Bishop is absolutely clear, and an excellent writer as well.In my opinion, despite the recent publication of Kevin Murphy's very comprehensive ML book, Bishop is still a better read. This is mostly because of his incredible clarity, but the book has other virtues: best in class diagrams, judiciously chosen; a lot of material, very well organized; excellent stage setting (the first two chapters). Now, sometimes he's a bit cryptic, for example, the proof that various kinds of loss lead to conditional median or mode is left as an exercise (ex 1.27). Murphy actually discusses it in some detail. This is true in general: Murphy actually discusses many things that Bishop leaves to the reader. I thought chapters three and four could have been more detailed, but I really have no other complaints.Please note that in order to get an optimal amount out of reading this book you should already have a little background in linear algebra, probability, calculus, and preferably some statistics. The first time I approached it was without any background and I found it a bit unfriendly and difficult; this is no fault of the book, however. Still, you don't need that much, just the basics.Update: I should note that there are some puzzling omissions from this book. E.g. f-score & confusion matrices are not mentioned (see Murphy section 5.7.2) - it would have been very natural to mention these concepts in ch 1, along with decision theory. Nor is there much on clustering, except for K-means (see Murphy ch 25). Not a huge deal, it's easy to get these concepts from elsewhere. I recommend using Murphy as and when you need, to fill in gaps.One more update: I've been getting into Hastie et al's ESL recently, and I'm really impressed with it so far - I think the practitioner should probably get familiar with both ESL and PRML, as they have complementary strengths and weaknesses. ESL is not very Bayesian at all; PRML is relentlessly so. ESL does not use graphical models or latent variables as a unifying perspective; PRML does. ESL is better on frequentist model selection, including cross-validation (ch 7). I think PRML is better for graphical models, Bayesian methods, and latent variables (which correspond to chs 8-13) and ESL better on linear models and density based methods (and other stuff besides). Finally, ESL is way better on ""local"" models, like kernel regression & loess. Your mileage may vary...They are both excellent books. ESL seems a bit more mathematically dense than PRML, and is also better for people who are in industry as versus academia (I was in the latter but now in the former),",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"The book is not written for a beginner or even an intermediate researcher.  This is a very serious book on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.  If you are looking for computer code you can lift and use in your home grown system, this is not in the book for you.  If you have not had some serious math courses beyond the basics.  You will quickly be lost.  I have had 15 graduate math and statistics classes and work in IT currently.  I purchased this book to help me with a research project I am doing on my own with pattern recognition where machine learning is important to the process.  Many of my own equations as I did my research appeared in this book.  I am using a relational database to store information and remember patterns.  If you don't have experience with numerical methods and turning equations in to computer code and can do it in your head.  You will have great deal of difficulty with this book.  That said as a warning, now to the book.  It is a great reference and spends a great deal of time several statistical theories and their practical uses in signal and pattern recognition.  It also has various ways for doing curve fitting and dealing with weighted neural networks.  While this is written as a text book, it is more of reference book.  I do not see how even a years course could work on all the information in this book.  One of my chief pet peeves is that text book publishers have websites and answers only professors can get to.  How about those of us who are finished with school and have no intention of ever going back?  So to the publisher Springer I give one star and zero if I could!  This is a reference book and most likely will never be a text book. This is true with this book.  Which is why I rate it four instead of five stars because of the publisher.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I was a big fan of Bishop's earlier ""Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition"" despite my not being particularly interested in neural networks (as opposed to other aspects of machine learning), and so I was pretty excited when I heard about this book.  Reading it has not left me disappointed.  Like his earlier book, this text is quite mathematically oriented, and not well-suited for people who aren't comfortable with calculus.  However, also like in ""NNPR"", the writing style here is very clear, and everything past basic calculus and linear algebra is well-explained before it's needed.  The appendices alone are a goldmine.  (Appendix B is a great ""cheat sheet"" for commonly used probability distributions; Appendix C has lots of useful matrix properties you may have forgotten or never known; Appendix D quickly explains what you need to know about the calculus of variations; and Appendix E does the same for Lagrange multipliers.)  The author also does an excellent job throughout the text of marrying math and intuition without giving either short shrift.However, note that the material covered is inherently pretty complex, so the book can still be intimidating in parts despite the excellent writing.  It's more appropriate for, say, Ph.D. students and professional researchers in statistics or machine learning than people who just want to crank out code for a simple classifier.  There is very little pseudocode (although copious MATLAB code will supposedly be made available in a companion book due out in 2008), and the book's overall approach to machine learning is basically hard-core Bayesian statistics.  If you are not willing to scratch your head for a while over lots and lots of equations, this may not be the book for you.On the flip side, people who are already experts in machine learning may be mildly disappointed with the lack of coverage some of their pet topics get.  For example, while the chapter on graphical models is excellent as far as it goes, it only mentions the problem of learning graphical model structures (one of my areas of interest) in passing.  Reinforcement learning (another personal area of interest) is discussed briefly in the introduction and then written off as beyond the scope of the book.However, the book is already a fabulous resource as it stands; complaining there's not even more of it would be gauche.  The cover may look like goat barf, and there are some innocuous missing words here and there (hey, it's a first edition), but if you're serious about machine learning and not afraid of a little math, you should definitely own this book.  I can only imagine how much cooler my own thesis research might have been if this book had been around a few years earlier.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"Overall, I like the book and would recommend it. But the exposition could use significant polishing.Pros:- not mathematically heavy; lots of good heuristics that capture the math without delving too far in- choice of topics and their discussion (e.g. a great place to learn about kernel methods and graphical models)- easy to get hooked on if you mind the gapsCons:- read below...While the exposition is spotty (compare e.g. with Feller or Gelman), the author manages to follow a mostly linear exposition on fascinating topics.The book would highly benefit from editing provided by someone with a solid math background. In particular, there are more good mistakes than bad mistakes... Often when speaking with people with more stats background than me, the conversation is isomorphic to:Me: ""...therefore, this statement is wrong. I think what he meant was...""Bro: ""Ah yes. But you get it, that's what he meant""Me: ""Then why didn't he write it?""But at least dialogues like these help cement ideas...Please correct me if any of the following contentions are wrong (I may update as I continue to read):Some parts are not even wrong, for example:Sec 2.1, paragraph above Eq. 2.19""We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood functions and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d data""First, if you follow the thread of this section and therefore go back to the contrived coin-flipping example, you would see that in the non-Bayesian point of view estimates are also updated in a sequence of experiments. Hence, a Bayesian point of view in this case is no more ""natural"" than a frequentist. Second, by definition of i.i.d., a single fixed distribution is postulated to exist, and therefore a prior is in fact chosen: how do you define a posterior without a prior? But ok, I think I get it: a sequential approach fits in nicely with the Bayesian point of view - I agree, and that's all that needs to be said.Mathematically wrong:Same section, following 2.3.5, the statement(s) following Eq. (2.20)""Note that in the limit of an infinitely large data set m, l -> infinity the result (2.20) reduces to the maximum likelihood (2.8).""First, if F is a function of x, then the resulting limit for x to infinity must not involve x. Plus, the order and/or direction of his m and l in the limit is ambiguous. Second, what he meant to say is that for m and l both sufficiently large compared with a and b, we get that (2.20) reduces to (2.8).3rd paragraph before 2.2:""For a finite data set, the posterior mean for mu always lies between the prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for mu corresponding to the relative frequencies of events given by (2.7).""Again we are told to forget that the choice of a prior makes a difference. It seems the above statement is false: we may choose a prior that is heavily weighted on a single point so that this prior's mean is greater than mle.Paragraphs directly above the beginning of 2.2:""In fact, we might wonder whether it is a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease..."" and then"" this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of theta is smaller than the prior variance.""The ""result"", i.e. Eq (2.24) is an assertion of the form: ""Suppose a,b, c > 0, c is fixed, and c = a +b. Then, if b goes up, a must go down."" I don't see how this relates to what seemed to be his premise that increasing the size of a data set (sequentially or not) has the seemingly desired effect of reducing posterior variance. I suspect there are in fact limiting results in special cases that show the desired ""steady"" reduction in posterior variance...I wish he would have referenced themSection 2.3, following Eq. 2.44""... we note that the matrix \Sigma can be taken to be symmetric...""Actually, by definition any covariance matrix *is* symmetric.I could go on...All this said, it's worth repeating:I like the book, and not only because its mistakes or sometimes shady logic encourage the interested reader to try and discover correct/less wrong statements.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I have two machine learning books currently; this book and the one by Prince on Computer Vision. I purchased Prince first, and followed up with this book, since in some ways I found Prince lacking some details and found some of his explanations difficult to follow (forward-backward algorithm for example), but overall was is good book and worth getting. I think in someways these two books are good compliments to each other. Prince focus heavily on application and sets up the problem, but does not necessarily tell you how to solve the problems (at least to the satisfaction of someone new to the topic like me). Bishop on the other hand does go through a lot of the details left out in Prince, but lacks examples to reinforce why I would even care about some of the topics covered. For example, I eventually skipped chapter 10 (approximate inference) after not seeing any immediate application for such an abstract topic.So back to why I am only giving this book only 3 stars. While Bishop does go through much of the math required to solve these types of problems, I ultimately find many of his explanations not very good. As one other reviewer pointed out, he has plenty of figures, but seldom do I think they provide much insight to what he is trying to explain. Case in point figure 11.1 is nothing more than two squiggly lines showing p(z) and f(z), one of which is an arbitrary probability density function and an arbitrary functional mapping of z. I think that by the time most people get being able to understand the material presented up to this point, they don't need this kind of figure. There are a few others, that while not as useless as this, could use a bit more description or clarification. Otherwise these figures are nothing more than squiggly lines.There are many topics here that I was hoping to learn from. For example, I had never learned anything on neural nets, and there is a whole chapter dedicated to that topic here. Unfortunately, I think the only thing that I can remember from this topic is that there different layers to the net, and I think in the process of him solving the equations of the neural net was ultimately using reverse auto-differentiation, but he even had some other goofy name for it (I think it was backward propagation). Another topic I was hoping to learn from was on support vector machines. I think this suffers from getting so buried in how to solve the problem, that even his examples show fairly complex decision boundaries (Figure 7.2, for example where he doesn't call out on the graph as showing what is what).And another issue with this is that the book has an appendix which describes the datasets used to generate many of the plots. However, if you go to the URL, the datasets are not there. Granted, the book was published in 2006, so certainly his website could have changed. It just is difficult to try and duplicate his methods to understand what he might ultimately be trying to say here.All in all, the book isn't bad. I think it works better as someone who already has an application in mind (and which method to use) but needs to be walked through the math to get an answer. After reading this book, I still wouldn't know which technique to use to get an answer to a problem that I have. Prince at least gives some applications and was a really interesting book.Update 9/22/16:I maybe was overly hard with my original review, however I will not be updating my star rating which I will explain why shortly. I read another machine learning book after this one ( Barber's Baysian Reasoning and Machine Learning). Overall, that other book is worthy of a 5 star review for learning the basics. After reading that book, which gives plenty of examples and clear explanations, this book does read a lot better. As I originally thought, this book does fill a good role as a book on how to solve problems, but not necessarily as a great starting place for those new to Machine Learning. Check out Barber's book for free from his website, and you will see what I mean.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"I can appreciate others who might think that this is a great book.... but I am a student using it and I have some very different opinions of it.First, although Mr. Bishop is clearly an expert in Machine Learning, he is also obviously a HUGE fan of Bayesian Statistics. The title of the book is misleading as it makes no mention of Bayes at all but EVERY CHAPTER ends with how all of the chapter's contents are combined in a Bayes method.  That's not bad it's just not clear from the title.  The title should be appended with ""... using Bayesian Methods""Second, while it is certainly a textbook, the author clearly has an understanding of the material that seems to undermine his ability to explain it.  Though there are mentions of examples there are, in fact, none.  There are many graphics and tiny, trivial indicators, but I can't help to think that every single one of the concepts in the book would have benefited from even a single application.  There aren't any.  I am lead to believe that if you are already aware of many of the methods and techniques that this would be an excellent reference or refresher.  As a student starting out I almost always have no idea what his intentions are.To make matter worse, he occasionally uses symbols that are flat-out confusing.  Why would you use PI for anything other than Pi or Product? He does.  Why use little k, Capital K, and Greek Letter Kappa (a K!) in a series of explanations. He does.  He even references articles that he has written... in 2008!!Every chapter seems to be an exercise to see how many equations he can stuff in it.  There are 300 in Chapter 2 alone.  Over and over and over again I have the feeling that he is trying to TELL me how to ride a bicycle when it would have been so much easier to at least let me see the view from behind the handle bars with my feet on the pedals.  Chapter five on Neural Nets, for example, is abysmally over-complicated.  Would you hand someone a dictionary and ask them to write a poem?  (""Hey, all the words you need are in here!"") Of course not.Third, the book mentions that there is a lot of information available on the web site.  The only info available on his website is a brief overview of the text, a detailed overview of the text (that's not a typo.... he has both), an example chapter, links to where the book can be purchased, and (actually, quite useful for creating slides) an archive of all of the figures available in the book.  There are no answers to problems or explorations of any part of the material.  The upcoming book might be amazing and exactly what I am looking for but it could be months away and another $50 or so to purchase it.  Hardly ideal. How about putting some of that MatLab code on your site?  *Something* to crystalize the concepts!Finally, while the intro indicates this might be a good book for Computer Scientists it would actually make more sense to call it a Math book.  More specifically a Statistics book.  There are no methods, no algorithms, no bits of pseudo-code, and (again) no applications are in the text.  Even examples that actually used hard numbers and/or elements from a real problem and explained would be much appreciated.Maybe I am being a little critical and perhaps I want for too much but in my mind if you are writing a book with the goal of TEACHING a subject, it would be in your interest to make things clear and illustrative.  Instead, the book feels more like a combination of ""I am smart. Just read this!"" and a reference text.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"Bishop's book about machine learing and pattern recognition is well written and the figures are really pretty because they are in color and informative. Overall the book looks very nice and it is fun to read in. In my opinion only the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie et al. looks comparably well.The book is a textbook rather than a monograph and, hence, intended for students rather than researchers and the coverage of machine learning topics is thorough without being able to cover every topic in deepth. This is not really a draw back because no book is able to do this anyway. The presentation of the methods is informative and, depending on the background of the reader, clear enough to figure out how it works to use the method.What is the problem: I do not like that the methods are introduced not rigourously but by examples. That mean Bishop does not have the definiton, theorem, proof style but is more heuristic. This may sound very helpful for the reader not familiar with the topic to reduce the barrier of understanding by providing examples to visulalize the problem. The problem is, in my opinion, that this is not the case but the oposite. In think it is never wrong to provide examples and it is absolutely desirable but after the examples are given and one has an intuitive understanding of the problem one wants to see its formal solution because that's what machine learning is about, it is applied statistics. For this reason I give only 4 instead of 5 points (but not less because also all the other books about this topic fail in this respect).Overall, the book is well done and certainly a good source of information for students and researches.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
"This graduate-level book is a very good reference for classic pattern recognition and machine learning methods. It might not be the best book for a first-time learner though since the author tends to jump-step a lot. This is understandable considering the amount of content and insightful discussions covered. For advanced learners, this book is one of the best. I really appreciate the mathematical discussions and derivations provided, which are essential for me to derive my own algorithms or models. I don't feel that it is lacking in examples at all. It actually has lots of good examples with great mathematical insights. (Again, this is from a researcher's perspective, not from a perspective of the end user of algorithms.) It also gives me solid mathematical backgrounds to understand state-of-the-art algorithms in research papers easily.This book tend to focus only on probabilistic, in particular, Bayesian methods (and does an excellent job doing that). Other important methods are mentioned very briefly or only discussed from the Bayesian perspective. I believe that each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses and this book does not do those approaches enough justices. Therefore, this book is not a comprehensive reference for pattern recognition and machine learning as it discusses these problems from mainly one perspective. But if your studies are in these areas, this is one of the top 5, must-have reference books.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics)
