The book I ordered arrived very quickly and in great condition. I would order from them again.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Natural Language Processing
"I got this today and have not really started to read it. The content looks good and the writing seem clear and well constructed. ( After all, this is a book about natural language. )However, the print quality is low. Only some subject heading are in black. It seems like 98% of the text is in various shades of grey. The coding examples are in light grey. It used to be okay to simply mark coding examples with a different font. This publisher seems to think making the coding examples harder to read is some desirable objective.Maybe the publisher is saving money on ink.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Natural Language Processing
"Typically, NLP textbooks are dense and mathematical. On the other hand are the more practical ones, which give a broad, end to end perspective on how to perform various tasks. In this book, we see a task wise split of chapters, but they are also designed in a more introductory manner, giving detailed conceptual understanding along with some hands on practice.  Author profiling as one of the tasks is perhaps unique to this NLP book.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Natural Language Processing
"Admittedly, I thought the book would be a bit over my head when I started.  And the hand holding thru important concepts quickly opened my eyes to concepts not only in natural language processing but in the underlying concepts such as geometry.I am a certified geek and am not sorry to admit that i go back to the book at night re-reading and suddenly have an 'aha-now i finally get it' moment.  The way how concepts are explained really suits my learning style.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Natural Language Processing
"I've studied this book as I was a Manning Beta Tester.  Prof Ekaterina Kochmar  has explained all the concepts of NLP nicely with the help of examples in each chapter.These examples are very practical i.e. Spam and Ham classification, Sentimental Analysis, Topic Analysis etc.Also, related machine learning concepts are explained in a detailed manner with the help of Scikit-learn.It is a must read for any Natural Language Practitioner.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Started with Natural Language Processing
Seldom do I come across a book that conveys most all needed (and anticipated) information in an easy to understand way. An extremely valuable book. This author is good.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Tools for Scientists: An Introduction to Using Anaconda, JupyterLab, and Python's Scientific Libraries"
"I feel terrible about taking so long for this. I got a free copy from Goodreads and I am under no obligation but am really interested in learning about topics like this. This book is really well written and logically organized, so anyone wanting to learn about Python can jump in from any level and learn about different topics.I'm still going through it and I hope I learn a lot more. Any time I might wonder about something, there is always a helpful illustration.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Tools for Scientists: An Introduction to Using Anaconda, JupyterLab, and Python's Scientific Libraries"
"As the title indicates, the book is targeted toward people wanting to get an entry point in the Python world for scientific or research work.  Those people should find this book to be very helpful.  If you are wanting a deep dive into the Python language, there are better resources.  Having said that, I have experience with using Python and there were some parts of the book that were still useful to me.The opening section about setting up the Python development environment was very detailed and seemed to drag a bit, but I suppose that detail is good and possibly necessary for someone just starting out.  I think some chapters should be read through (setting up the environment, Python language basics) while others are better served as being reference material (scientific libraries).  All in all, this book could be a useful resource for many people.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Python Tools for Scientists: An Introduction to Using Anaconda, JupyterLab, and Python's Scientific Libraries"

The book is written to make the subject matter understood quite well.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Practical SQL, 2nd Edition: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data"
"This book is outstanding, but for the moment, you should only entertain the printed copy.  There are many code samples and output listings in the book—just about one listing every three paragraphs or so.  But while the printed copy has nicely delimited source code with hierarchical nesting, and has nicely tabulated columnar output for data, the Kindle edition has somehow lost all its formatting for code and data.  It's just about impossible to work out what is intended in the figures.  It might be okay in Apple Books epub format, but I've not seen that one.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Practical SQL, 2nd Edition: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data"
"I had to buy this kindle because i beed the information. In numerous instances, the code query examples, output,etc. is mess up.As one example repeated numerous times, in one query example the column data the rows in the table are instead filled with dashes, and all the actual data that is supposed to populate those columns and rows is all shifted far to the right,  so you get to play this tedious little game of mentally matching the column and its data to the column name.  When you multiply this stupid little crap by the numerous instances of it, the result is one tedious study experience.I gave up and bought the paper book also. (Maybe this is somebody’s overall strategy.)ANGRY that i paid for that kindle. It’s an insult to my hard earned money!",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Practical SQL, 2nd Edition: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data"
"I am almost done with reading this book and I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is very wordy. Which ends up making the text seem boring in a sense. However, I do not think this book was written for people like me who would have preferred the text to go through more of the database design process than data manipulation. Hence I assume that this book would fit a data science quite well but a dev trying to quickly learn a stack before graduation not so much.Would I buy it again? => Nope, I would go for a thinner quicker read. But I am going to keep it and use it as a reference to any future data manipulation.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Practical SQL, 2nd Edition: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data"
"This is the bible for anyone doing dyadic research. Within the social sciences, researchers are collectively beginning to realize the importance of acknowledging interdependence in their data to conduct more meaningful statistical analyses, whether it be a simple mixed-measures ANOVA, MLM, of SEM. The authors do a fine job explaining why interdependence is important to account for and what happens if you ignore it. They follow it up with techniques of analyzing dyadic data using various statistical procedures. It helps going into this book if you are comfortable with some statistical nuts and bolts, such as the theory behind hypothesis testing and analyses of variance. Of course, knowledge of more advanced techniques such as MLM and SEM won't hurt either.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dyadic Data Analysis (Methodology in the Social Sciences)
"There are very few people who are brilliant at understanding statistics (really understanding it deeply) and gifted at explaining it to others. Kenny and his colleagues are such people. He brought us the distinction between moderators and mediators and developed the ""gold standard"" test for mediation. Now, he and his colleagues point out the problems inherent in analyzing dyadic data and explain how to analyze such data. If your data include 2 or more people who interact with one another, this book is a must have for data analysis.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dyadic Data Analysis (Methodology in the Social Sciences)
I am using this book to assist with designing my methodology for my dissertation.  The language is not technical.  The authors made this text easy to understand and follow the concepts.  The best thing about this text is that they start with a simple concept and build on it throughout the book so this makes it easier to learn and most importantly to retain!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dyadic Data Analysis (Methodology in the Social Sciences)

I am very pleased with this book. It helps pull together the concepts I have read in articles written by Kenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dyadic Data Analysis (Methodology in the Social Sciences)
"I first read Tukey's book maybe 30 years ago. It had a profound effect on me. I had always spent time playing with data: this analysis, that analysis, various plots, etc. But I had never thought of it as something that could be approached in a systematic way, and that that there were many ""easy"" back-of the envelope techniques for getting a sense of your data to quickly understand what you had. In a sense Tukey licensed the idea that data was fun to play with and something that you could just fiddle with as much as you wanted.I think of it as in the same class as mental arithmetic: sure, you have a calculator on your phone; but it's way too slow to get out of your pocket and poke at the screen when all you want is 7*9 or even 387/3. Stem-and-leaf plots let you get a quick idea of what's there, without having to write some script. These skills come in handy all the time.Like everyone, I use a computer for non-trivial data analysis. But Tukey is usually in there, somewhere. For example his box-and-whisker diagrams are in many if not all plotting packages. They look nice and you might even have used them. But understanding the original insights lets you use these tools more effectively.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classic)
"I was not surprised to see that one of the issues raised by previous reviewers is whether or not this book is still relevant, given the enormous improvements in computing since this book was written. While I recognize that there are a lot of good ideas in this book, I must say that far too much of the text is devoted to techniques that are only relevant if one is doing data analysis on paper. This is certainly not to slander Tukey's own extensive knowledge of computing -- simply an admission of the fact that when EDA was written, few readers would have had access to any computing resources, let alone anything comparable to those that are available today. Today, the books suffers for this. A new version of this book, updated to take advantage of today's computing resources, would be quite valuable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Exploratory Data Analysis (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classic)
This book is helpful when conducting thematic analysis and is the most version of Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thematic Analysis: A Practical Guide
"Thematic analysis is an aspect of research that I've had a shifting response to over the years. At first TA felt deceptively simple, as I learned more it felt impossible, like trying to discover the meaning of the universe. This book is such a great guide! Whether you decide to use reflexive TA or some other approach to thematic analysis, I strongly recommend purchasing this book. The clear descriptions are super useful. I know I'll refer to this book in years to come.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Thematic Analysis: A Practical Guide

"Participants in my lab's qualitative studies provide rich information that both addresses our structured questions and also reflects their own narratives. These data are well-suited to both inductive and deductive approaches to thematic analysis.

"Good book, intuitive explanations for many commonly used algorithms. The author includes lots of java code where you can implement it on your own and just look it up if you actually do have any trouble. The exercises are good practice, but many of them were much more difficult to do than you would expect after reading a chapter. so the content for the book was very good for me as a student, i always reference back to it to check how some algorithms go and whatnot. I am a student in university by the way.  The one problem I had is that at the end of my first semester of ownership, the binding of the book is already falling apart. This is from an official version from Pearson publishing too, not one of those international versions.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java: International Edition
"This is not a required book but a reference book for Data Structure class. Our school does have our own lectures which are mainly focusing on teaching the materials. This book works as a quick reference, so, it requires you to have solid knowledge to be able to read it.Again, this book will not teach you. It is only your quick reference source. And it is very good at its job.So, please stop giving it low rate, since it might be your incorrectly expectation about it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java: International Edition
"I find the concepts presented in my data structures very intuitive, so I haven't had to use this textbook much; however, the language the author uses is clear and concise, and I will likely keep this textbook as a reference after my class is over. Of course, I wish that the language weren't Java -- I'm a Pythonite. Even so, the code is easy to follow regardless of background, and you can always lean on the pseudocode algorithms as necessary.I recommend it strongly for undergrads pursuing a degree in CS who will be referring to these concepts again and again in future classes.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java: International Edition
"I got the book really quickly after I ordered it for a class.  While the contents are good, I would have liked it more if the class actually used it for things other than examples.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java: International Edition
"Look, I'll be honest. I'm one of the few students that actually uses and appreciates textbooks. I don't like doing my reading online either because I like having a physical copy to mark, make notes in, and pass through. And I don't often groan about textbooks either. Sure, they're overwhelmingly boring. But for the most part, I find them useful (some more than others) and read them cover to cover. So to get me cranky about a textbook you have to do your fair share.And oh does Mark Allen Weiss deliver. The book is a complete nightmare. A great textbook is able to walk the reader through each part of the field he's learning, teaching it to him one piece at a time. I've always said if a textbook is great, you should be able to learn the subject from it without the aid of a teacher. Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java isn't even adequate or below par -- it's straight garbage. It's the sort of book that makes one thankful for the premise of Farenheit 451.The author frequently likes to explain things while missing out important steps in the logic -- steps which may be obvious to experts in the field, people who have been studying computer science and mathematics for a long time, or exceptionally keen students, but which will utterly befuddle the rest of us. His English is clunky. He has a very unique talent for phrasing things in the most non-intuitive way possible. Relatively simple topics become a nightmare.I've spent the semester spending hours on Khan Academy, Google, or in my instructor's office seeking clarification of topics because trying to learn from this book is utterly hopeless. I'm learning Data Structures just fine, but this book has only been an obstacle to that process, not a help.Do not waste your money on this garbage. You won't use it. Even if you're a stickler for textbooks, trust me, this isn't worth it.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java: International Edition
"I'm currently in a Computer Science program at a university, and while I haven't started my Data Structures and Algorithms, I figured getting a head start on some reading would be a good idea. I bought this textbook as an additional resource to used, and even though I've only read a couple of pages, I felt strongly compelled to write a review.  So far, my only complaint is that the reading seems ineffectively heavy such as when explaining what vertices and edges are in Graph Theory; vertices are nodes, or points in a graph, and edges connect vertices together, but the author in this textbook uses wordy paragraphs to explain vertices and edges; while some complex concepts do require detail descriptions, you shouldn't have to put any effort in comprehending basic concepts.  I have two other Data Structures and Structures, and this one is my least favorite. I'll continue to reference this textbook, and if I changed my mind, I'll update my review, but I wouldn't recommend buying this textbook.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java: International Edition

"I'm using this for my first algorithm course at college and I have to say that this is a terrible book for me at my current level. The book does not have a thorough explanation on any data structures. The analysis in algorithms are unclear. It skips a lot of fundamentals, too.

"This is a reasonably well-written book. I cranked through it this past weekend and passed the Data+ certification. However, there are some areas that I would recommend you supplement if you want to pass the certification:1) SQL Queries: For example, you should know your inner, outer, and full joins very well. This isn't really covered sufficiently in this text. So, unless you have experience in SQL, you will want to supplement this area of your studies.2) Designing a Dashboard: Make sure you research best practices and actually view several real-world examples of well-designed dash boards. Again, while there is some coverage, I'm not sure it's sufficient if you don't have existing experience in UX, design, or dashboard creation.Otherwise, solid resource for this certification.",4.0 out of 5 stars,CompTIA Data+ Study Guide: Exam DA0-001
"Bottom line: if your priority is to learn or review concepts, this book will serve you well. If you're looking more for quizzes and practice tests, I would recommend against this. I found the question bank to be actively detrimental to my understanding and full of errors.The book itself is very good. It clearly explains the concepts for the exam and strikes a good balance between detail and not overwhelming the student.The problem is that the quizzes and practice exams included are not even close to the same quality. Between the questions where the ""correct"" answer directly contradicts the text, to those where an entirely made-up throwaway choice is somehow the right answer, to those where the explanation refers to a different question than what was asked, there's a massive dropoff in quality from the text itself.The Wiley website where the quizzes and tests are hosted (mandatory signup to access the two full practice tests and flashcards, optional for the chapter quizzes) is ok, although the registration process seems purpose-built to be annoying.Since Data+ is still a new exam as I'm writing this, there aren't a lot of study resources available. Unfortunately, it seems like this study guide was rushed out to try and take advantage of that fairly empty market. Hopefully a future edition fixes the serious flaws of this book, but as of 2022, the built-in evaluations fall far short.",3.0 out of 5 stars,CompTIA Data+ Study Guide: Exam DA0-001

"This is an excellent book on categorical analysis. My advice to anyone planning to use this book is to study the first 4 chapters very carefully and very thoroughly. These chapters form the heart of the analysis, and describe the tests that follow in the most general setting. After the first 4 are done, go through chapters 5 and 6, and you will realize that logistic regression is a special case of the results you have already learned. The rest of the book is best used as a reference (in my opinion) and one can look into the relevant sections as needed.The 2  important things reading this book has taught me to look for are (1) the role of cofounders in categorical analysis (see the example in section 2.3.2 for an illustration) and (2) effective groupings, when one of the entries in the contingency table is scarce",5.0 out of 5 stars,Categorical Data Analysis (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)

However, I would have purchased the book from the school bookstore if not for amazon's promised ""buy it by BLANK time today and, if you choose two-day shipping, get it by BLANK"" .

"R in Action does an excellent job showing the power of the R language. The book also serves a way to learn statistics and data science through using the R language.At the beginning the examples are practical, showing how to make graphs based off data sets that come packaged with R. Sometimes packages are required to install to get the examples running, and the author is clear about how to do this.In chapter eight there was an excellent description about Regression analysis. I knew what regressions were, but this explanation helped clear up some confusion I had. The author says (p.167): ""It's [regression analysis] a broad term for a set of methodologies used to predict a response variable (also called a dependent, criterion, or outcome variable) from one or more predictor variables (also called independent or explanatory variables).Following this explanation is a concrete example given showing how to predict the number of calories a person burns on a treadmill based off different factors. I liked that the author defined all the terms, and then gave a concrete example. It is a pattern throughout the book that worked very well.The later parts of the book briefly dive in machine learning and more advanced data science concepts.The main focus of the book is on statistics, graphing, and plotting. This worked well, because it shows the areas where R shines compared with other languages. Luckily for the reader the author knows which techniques work well, and states when certain data analysis techniques work better than others. The author remains humble throughout, stating when he finds a topic complex.R in Action is a great resource for learning R and learning statistics. Explanations transition from easy to hard in a logical manner and this book will be useful for data scientists of all experience levels.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R
"I have read quite a few books on R, and will rate this as perhaps one of the best if not the best. The author has explained the material with excellent clarity, the examples are relevant to real-world applications, and the code executes well using either base installation of R (with added packages) or R studio. Also, the author has managed to concurrently develop both data analysis and data visualization (graphing), which helps the reader, and exposes the capabilities of R very well. The range of topics covered in this book is very broad and gives a good overview of the field. As a clinician with interest in epidemiology, I found almost everything needed for beginner or intermediate level applications. Also, if one works through this book diligently, s/he will be in a very good position to follow more advanced topics (like multilevel models) from other resources.I have only one issue with the book (which is a generic issue with most statistics or data science books centered around a software). That is, it contains very little, if any, mathematical basis or details of the methods being discussed. These days, statistics is taught ""thorough"" a software. Hence, it is artificial to separate mathematical statistics from computational aspects. I am waiting for a book which will start with the mathematical aspects including derivations of the theorems/equations, give examples of real world applications, and illustrate the application in R.One minor issue is related to very poor quality of the binding of the book. In the copy that I received, perhaps the pasting was defective, and as soon as I first opened it, the first page tore off. Soon, the binding opened up and pages/sections started falling off. I am not sure if this is just limited to the copy that I got or is a systemic issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R
"This is the first product review I have ever written.  I wanted to share how wonderful this book is.  I have glanced through about 20 R books searching for the right one to have as the manual that you don't get with R.  I chose correctly this time (after making a mistake first).  ""R in Action"" is thorough, clearly written, written in a logical order, it gives examples for everything, and it even gives 3 ways to do the same thing if applicable.  As a beginning data scientist, I know that this book will be sitting on my desk and have many tabs in it to mark the places where I don't quite have the material memorized.  AND when you purchase the print version of the book, you get an ebook for free, which is so helpful since this is a programming book.

"Overall quite a fan and recommend the book! I am a graduate student who was struggling with some analyses, and this provided a great overview on the code + logic behind the analyses in a way that helped me get what I needed to do done quickly (quicker than looking up internet sources). Seems like it's going to be a great reference to have on hand at all times when putting R into practice with research. The one thing (thus far) I am disappointed with is that the code for graphs isn't complete -- frequently will say that the following code produces graph #xyz. However, the code really only produces the most basic version of the graph in the book, and they don't include the extra code for ACTUALLY reproducing (which would be handy if new to graphs and trying to figure out some basic formatting manipulations without a lot of work)",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R
"There are far too many good things to say about this book and the author. It offers a good balance for those wishing to refresh their knowledge on R to more advance users wishing to pick up a few new tricks. Some of the concepts covered may not have been addressed in enough detail for those not experienced with R, but there are countless other supplemental sources that can be used along with this book. The author does a great job explaining statistical concepts. I would recommend this book to practitioners and teachers alike for that reason. Those focusing on statistical analysis (statistics) or data mining would enjoy this book. It doesn't cover more advance concepts in-depth like some books I have read, but that isn't this book's goal. If you want to learn more about machine learning, structural equation modeling, or more advanced analyses like neural network analysis, then you should find a book that specializes in those areas.",5.0 out of 5 stars,R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R

"My reading of ""Data Cartels"" written by Sarah Lamdan has been, I'm sorry to say, a painful six months in the making, even for an avid reader like me who reads the books laden on the coffee table in my doctor's office. This thought-provoking book dives deep into the world of data monopolies and the dangers they pose to our society. The author manages to recreate a modern-day witch hunt targeting large conglomerates (RELX, Thomson Reuters, and Bloomberg) that she condemns for collecting troves of information with some nefarious purpose.Lamdan argues that the concentration of data power into a few hands leads to the creation of data cartels. These cartels are monopolizing access to data and controlling the infrastructure through which the data is transmitted and processed.The author takes a critical look at the impact of these data cartels on our society, including the potential for increased inequality, the erosion of privacy, and the stifling of innovation. Lamdan argues that these cartels have the power to shape the future of society and that we must take action to prevent their dominance.The book provides an analysis of the data economy based on the back of a few in the industry. Lamdan examines the role of some tech companies, governments, and the general public in this ecosystem. She presents a clear and concise overview of the current state of the data economy and the challenges we face in ensuring fair and equitable access to data.One of the things I was disappointed about in this book is that Lamdan focused most of her work on criticizing large corporations and should have offered a sustainable solution to the problem at hand instead of a few ideas. Lamdan needs to realize that the aggregation of data, algorithms and SQL statements aren't amassed or created to be discriminatory.In my line of work, where would the retail industry be without the data collected by Computer-Generated Ordering (CGO) and Point of Sales Systems (POS)? Or, my favourite, the data that continues to fuel the performance of eCommerce platforms in serving retail customers? Collecting and interpreting data is in the interest of retailers and consumers alike. Extracting answers to questions about customer preferences can be tricky, but it should not be viewed with suspicion. Rather, retailers looking to model customer profiles using various data sources are working with a singular purpose: to provide an exchange of personalized value that ultimately benefits consumers.In summary, ""Data Cartel"" is a drooping eye book that tries to address the growing concentration of data power in the hands of a few, wrapped in a modern-day bore. I don't recommend this book to anyone interested in the future of technology and society.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Data Cartels: The Companies That Control and Monopolize Our Information

"I'm a Python software developer with an interest in applied statistics. This is an excellent book on data analysis, but for review purposes, it's worth initially pointing out what this book is not.It is not a comprehensive survey of open source tools that are available, and it does not contain many examples of working code to implement the techniques he talks about, though there are some. For this reason, I'd strike the ""with Open Source Tools"" from the title in evaluating whether you want to purchase the book.The author greatly favors mathematical notation over code examples in describing the data analysis techniques he presents. While this is not a bad thing per se, you'll have to struggle to comprehend the content if you're a programmer without an academic familiarity with math, or if you've been away from mathematics for a long time.As other reviewers have pointed out, the organization of the content is somewhat disjointed. Going from chapter to chapter, there is little in the way of causality, and the early chapters are pretty math-heavy. The reader is advised to consult appendices at the back of the book to refresh themselves on the basics, if required.Wait! I didn't say you shouldn't buy it.Despite a few shortcomings, this book does offer a good introduction and overview of several basic techniques. It's an excellent survey of the current data analysis landscape for anyone who's not familiar with it. If a topic seems irrelevant to you, it's pretty easy to skip that chapter and move forward.On top of that, the author's writing style and ways of explaining relatively esoteric concepts is generally very good. As with many good books, you get the sense the author is a co-worker, trying to explain something to you in terms you can understand. It's very example-based, even if those examples don't always involve code.All in all, to get the most out of this book, the best approach is careful and methodical study. The author covers many topics quickly, and not any one in depth, so if one chapter interests you, I'd plan on consulting other resources on particular topics. Luckily, the author does offer several ""Further Reading"" recommendations for each topic.Most books containing information on these techniques are far harder to read, and they generally cost at least twice as much. Highly recommended. Thanks for this one, Philipp.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"Data Analysis with Open Source Tools does a great job covering a lot of topics in way that balances theoretical explanations and practical demonstration. In keeping true to its title, a wealth of tools (and data sources) are identified and explored.Because the book offers a balance between explanation and demonstration it can be read in two different ways. First, you can read the chapters without getting involved with the code to get a better understanding of the whys and hows of the different analysis techniques. On the other hand, if you are more of a brass tacks person, you can focus on the code, run the examples, and just skim the explanations.For those that are exploring the world of data analysis, this book is a great compliment to Segaran's

 and Russell's 
Mining the Social Web: Analyzing Data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Other Social Media Sites
. Where the books overlap the explanations and examples differ which helps enormously when trying to master the concepts and techniques. However, each book contains topics not in the others. Collectively they offer a rather powerful set of tools.Having read the other books prior to this one, I really appreciated the time spent on the mathematics behind each technique. The others get your hands dirty very quickly - and I appreciated that greatly when first exploring data mining - but I found myself wanting to have a deeper understanding which this book so nicely provides. As Janert mentions in the first chapter, the succinct notation of mathematics is much clearer than having to try to extract the essence of twenty lines of source code. Without a doubt, though, Data Analysis is dense which and that might turn a few people off.All said and done, I'm glad I took the time to read the book and will definitely keep it nearby.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"The book has lofty ambitions, and after a perusal of the table of contents, appears to live up to it. But after delving into the book, I was extremely disappointed. Here are the core problems:1) The most glaring omission: the author will often finish an entire section describing how to use an open source tool to analyze data, WITHOUT TELLING YOU WHAT TOOL HE IS USING. Take Chapter 6, for example (""Intermezzo: A Data Analysis Section""). He begins belting out lines of code like ""plot 'data' u 1 w 1"" without ever stating what language or what tool he's actually using. A simple ""I'm using gnuplot"" would suffice. But he literally finishes the entire chapter without ever telling the reader that he's using gnuplot. That information is not contained in headers, in the text, in the chapter, in code comments - nowhere. I ended up using Google to determine what language the syntax was for.2) All of the examples are unrealistic, contrived, or elementary. The author conjures up datasets that are ""amazingly"" well-adapted to whatever technique is being discussed, does not re-use data sets to illustrate different points, and overall leaves the reader feeling like they've been through a whirlwind of different data sets without any deep grasp of the principles involved.3) The author gives plenty of lip service to people who are ""scared"" of math, and says things like ""Don't be scared by big formulas!"", but a few pages later is belting out complex mathematical concepts with no explanation of what he's talking about. As a reader familiar with advanced statistics, I was left feeling like the book consisted of a LOT of filler material for the ""scared of math"" crowd, which really bored me. The author needs to pick one audience or the other, and write the book to that audience. Otherwise, he's trying to ride two horses going different directions.4) The programs and code in this book were shallow, and often had requirements for the data formatting that went unstated in the text or in the comments of the code. For example, the LOESS function the author gives (4 or 5 lines, at the end of Chapter 3) requires the data to be sorted and in order. Otherwise it's all senseless. But the author doesn't state this fact.The one good thing I got out of this book was the bibliography - it was useful to get a data scientist's list of books for each topic, and a sentence or two about each book's strengths and weaknesses.It's like all the editors of this book were asleep at the switch. I've had some of the same exact issues with other O'Reilly books (the ""riding two horses"" problem of simultaneously writing for very technical and very non-technical audiences, and the problem of unstated assumptions and requirements for functions and code). O'Reilly books used to be high caliber. Now, they're poor-quality books that rush through their topic and never give a thorough treatment.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I bought this book hoping for a reference on open source tools.  But the open source tools are a minor aspect of this book.  The core is about data analysis--and it is fantastic.  I should have known this from the title I suppose: the ""data analysis"" is in big font with a colorful background, and ""with open source tools"" is in small font--and it is literally about the same ratio with the book.  Each chapter has small section that works one example with an open source tool.  And there is a chapter at the end about the array of open source tools available.But the data analysis aspects of the book--most outstanding.  I have a master's in computer science, and do data and analytics for a living, so I have many books on the topic.  Some books with more of a theoretical and rigorous foundation, some with more of a hands-on slant.  I was expecting this book to be the latter, but it is quite the former.Yet it is still very practical.  It is not a ""theory"" work as such, just a rigorous book useful in practice (there is a big difference!).  Throughout the book the author points out the value of solving the problem at hand, rather than being excessively precise--which is the bigger risk in this domain.  Examples would be: using visuals to get a feel for data but not trying to use visuals to give precise answers (which they fundementally cannot), and using techniques that get ""close enough"" such as perturbation.And it is extremely well written.  The writing is in reasonably simple English, relative to the topic, yet not insulting or goofy the way the ""Dummies"" series can be for example.  It is easy to read yet content rich--a fantastic combination.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I love this book on data analysis, but I do understand not everybody likes this style.From a theoretical physics background, I appreciate the book and the author a lot. The writer put a lot of effort in explaining the background on each topic from the perspective of someone who knows a bit about the topic but not in depth. People who are currently data scientists are from different technical background, and the text is a good introduction into the topics. Technical details are not overwhelming, which is good for people who can pick up the technicalities on their own through other books and the web.If one is looking for the open source tools implementation, he is certainly disappointed. (The title of the book is unfortunately misleading.) If one is looking for technical details, this is not a good option for them. However, to gain the insights and the big picture, this is the best book.The following chapters are well written:- Chapter 2 (A Single Variable: Shape and Distribution): This brings people into the style of the book, some basics to data analysis and wrangling, and an introduction to NumPy.- Chapter 8 (Models from Scaling Arguments): Mathematical modeling to data, something a lot of theorists doing!- Chapter 9 (Arguments from Probability Models).- Chapter 13 (Finding Clusters): Introduction to various clustering (unsupervised learning) techniques.- Chapter 18 (Predictive Analytics): Something hot recently.

"I'm a data scientist and I've had this book now for more than two years, and I find myself taking it off the shelf time and again to review a topic I haven't worked on in awhile. The main reason is because it provides straight explanations on almost any question I have regarding data analysis, data interpretation, analytics, techniques, software, and further reading. The author, a physicist by training with years of real-world experience, has a way of explaining a topic well without the formalism you would find in a textbook (and by no means do I suggest that this book can replace a textbook). But if you need to dive deeper into an area I recommend reading a few pages in this book first before you start reading a textbook. The author also shares his opinion frequently, which I find useful. Even if you disagree with it, reading it prompts you to think about a topic deeper, and that's when good things happen.

"While I'm not an expert in all the areas covered in this book, I am in a few.  In those areas, this book is really wrong -- actually doing damage wrong.For instance, when talking about regressions, the author claims that:1) ""Regression only makes sense when you want to use it as a prediction.""  This a very wrong.  Any decent Econometrics book well be almost entirely about counter examples.2) ""Linear regression is appropriate only if the data can be described as a straight line.""  The ""linear"" in linear regression doesn't mean that at all.  It just means that the form of the function must be linear in the coefficients to be calculated.  In particular, x = a + b*x + c*x^2 will fit a parabola to the data.3) ""Historically, one of the attractions of linear regression has been that it is easy to calculate.""  It's easy to calculate for a single independent variable but multivariate regression are devilishly difficult to calculate because of numerical issues.The is where I really have problems because multiple regression models are one of the most useful techniques available for understanding the effect of different factors and the author just dismisses them out of hand.There are other problems:When talking about the CDF, he defines it as the integral of the histogram.  The histogram is not the probability density function.  The PDF is defined to integrate to 1 where the histogram integrates to something else.The formula for standard deviation is wrong, the formula for exponential moving average is wrong (a typesetting problem).So, my problem is that I find a lot of problems with the portions of the book I know.  Can I trust the remainder of the book or should I be wary?  In this case, I'm wary.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I've read some of the other reviews, and I do agree with most of the criticisms. There are quite a few errors in formulas and in the text, and it would've been really nice if the source codes and data files were given in a CD or were available on a website.That being said, the book addresses a lot of different topics - ranging from the introductory, freshman-level statistics to more advanced data mining and machine learning techniques, and passing through notions of design. It doesn't go in depth into each of them, but offers a fairly good overview, and references in case you're interested. Furthermore, the author gives some useful hints on how to do outside-the-box thinking and how to apply these techniques into business.Being a physics grad student, I've found many of the topics pretty much basic, but even so, I've learned a lot. Overall, a great introduction; I really hope the flaws are corrected on a future 2nd edition.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"Lucid, learned, and full of insights--a great book on a difficult subject. When I pre-ordered this title, I expected it to be more cookbook-oriented. There are certainly cookbook aspects to it, but it goes way beyond that. For one, it's deep: Janert gives you solutions, sure, but you also get considerable background to go with them. I particularly like chapter 9's sagacious treatment of probability models, especially the section on power law distributions. For another, it's comprehensive--there is a lot of material here, and it's delivered with discipline and care. You can tell that Janert really pushed himself (maybe with a bit of help from his editor) when writing this book. Finally, this book has heart. Data analysis is a means to an end (albeit a wonderful, fascinating one), and the author does his best to ensure that we the reader keep the objective in mind--to inform and enlighten--all the while ensuring that we know enough to pick the right tool for the job. Chapter 16 is another stand-out, and I especially appreciated Janert's distinction here between operational and representative reports and his point about the former: good design emphasizes the content. That's a bit of Tufte-esque advice that we would all do well to remember.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists
"I don't expect much when I brought the book. Part of it is that its title is a little bit vague. But it turned out that I learned quite a lot from it. Many books contain materials that one can easily find on the internet free. This book is different. It is not a reference book nor a textbook that goes through some subject systematically. It contains topics that are quite diverse and incoherent and is from the author's personal experience. However, it does not decrease its value. Instead, it adds value and makes it unqiue. It is not dry and do not filled with so-called ""humor"" or useless generic statements about the field. It is not hard to read. In fact it feels more that a peronsal journal in data analysis that the author walk with you and share his experience with you. When you finish the journey with him, you pick up a bunch of useful ideas and techniques in data analysis that you can use in your own work. Highly recommended!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Analysis with Open Source Tools: A Hands-On Guide for Programmers and Data Scientists

"Mesh advances the analytics domain in ways I'd not considered, but should have. My career has been in technology in small-cap public companies, and historically I've embraced the notion of a centralized analytics team creating and supporting: data pipelines, ELT/ETL, data lake, data marts, etc. Mesh blows up this mental model in favor of decentralized data elements surfaced via API's, and closer to their domain ownership.Dehghani posits a product model for analytic data, where functional teams surface data from operational systems, microservices, etc. directly. No longer reliant on a central team to provide a single source of truth; Rather, they expose data in a more raw form (my words), servicing both their own domain as well as others through defined data ports.

Dehghani uses examples from a fictitious streaming music service that seems to mirror Spotify.There's certainly much more, and I recommend Data Mesh to anyone in a technology role. While I applaud her vision, and agree, directionally, with Mesh, there are three areas that I struggled with.First, the Mesh model seems much better suited to a larger tech company such as an Apple, Amazon, Spotify, etc. In my experience, SMB's just don't have the budget/headcount to support the expansive vision that Mesh espouses.Second, Mesh leans heavily toward ""states rights"" and away from central control. The success of this model hinges on knowledgeable, talented technical resources willingly collaborating for a greater good. That, in turn, presumes the existence/extension of global standards, the right culture of adherence to standards, adequate resources to serve the greater good (supporting deprecated API's for the benefit of other domains, for example), etc. In my experience, when the going gets tough, functions/domains tend to become more self-serving.Third, the vision of Mesh is fantastic, and fantastically broad. With data governance and privacy controlled through code. Consistent documentation, both human and computer, available for all data objects. Eschewing data lakes, warehouses, marts in favor of joins across domain API's (again, my words). Although Dehghani seeks to avoid monolithic solutions, I had to wonder if that isn't exactly where a fully-realized Mesh infrastructure ends up.Data Mesh is a bit redundant in pushing its vision for decentralization. It reads very much like a graduate software engineering text, with many references (many are excellent). Overall, very well written and a compelling vision that aligns perfectly with a microservices strategy, digital transformation and a product focus. Although it would be counter to Dehghani's specific vision of avoiding monolithic solutions, I have to wonder if a younger analytics company like Snowflake will try to run with it.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"TL;DR: a book of ideas, not solutions.If you are looking for a resource to explain what Data Mesh is, its core principles, origin, main advantages, pitfalls, etc., then this book has you covered.If you are looking for a ""playbook"" for how to implement it. Look elsewhere.It is a very prescient work in the sense that the author deeply understands data, and the problems of working with data that originate from modern centralized structures (a.k.a. the ""modern data stack"" - lakes, warehouses, etc.). She prescribes a methodology for affronting this issues through strategy, organizational changes, and forward thinking architectures.Part I tells you what Data Mesh is and the underlying principles. Part II tells you the ""why"" of Data Mesh. Parts III & IV tell you how to design the various components, and part V tells you how to get started.The concept of ""data as a product"" is very compelling, and this section is extremely well done. I had first gotten a glimpse of crude data products when studying Snowflake's Marketplace, which is in essence a catalog of datasets with a basic implementation of the SLOs (service-level objectives) and sharing features as prescribed by Zhamak Dehghani in this book.The reason for the low rating has to do with the fact that beyond explaining what it is, and why we should care, there's hardly anything more of value for the interested reader.It is far, far too high-level, and too theoretical to be of any use to somebody looking for a way to start. Some sections are downright philosophical. The author is aware of this and mentions it toward the end of the book.What if I told you, ""How do you design a car? Well, it should provide a means of locomotion through some sort of engine that propels it forward while providing affordances for the driver to steer this machine through a decentralized mesh of pavement that connects highly populated nodes of human folk - it must be usable, understandable, and have value of its own... The ignition, combustion, materials, stopping, engineering and other considerations are beyond the scope of this book.""Not quite as bad as this, but I'm not over exaggerating either.It gets very terse and repetitive as well. You will read entire re-worded paragraphs from previous sections over and over. Honestly, I kinda loved the book but each consecutive chapter reinforced my view that it needed a more exacting editor.I would say that anyone working with data should read chapters 1-5 (Part I) and maybe Part II as well, since it presents a clear picture of the problems with the modern data stack. Parts III, IV, and V are unlovable.I would perhaps end by saying that it feels like this is a text that is ahead of its time, as the implementation of these ideas are still beyond the reach of most with the technology and organizational structures of today (unless you are Spotify, Google, etc...)Still, a must read if you want to know where the industry is going and where it should be.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"This book is the missing manual. If you're in any data driven organization &/or managing an organization through a transformation with the goal to manage distributed data as products, this is a must read.The book is technology agnostic. What it does very well is lay out a very thorough map for what shape data, technologies & teams should look like, what functions they should fulfill & how they should all interoperate as a system to manage data as product successfully. It provides a somewhat idealized vision, but I'm all in as I've seen some of this in action & helped put some of these systems in place.At MarkLogic we helped organizations implement solutions that managed data as product. (I no longer work at MarkLogic & have nothing to gain here in promoting them, just sharing my experience.) MarkLogic integrated data from various silos within large organizations to create data products. Above the silos of data were silos of people that also required integrating. Change management was always a challenge. I recommend How Stella Saved the Farm & The Phoenix Project to help others start to understand the types of changes they need to embrace to succeed. But what was missing was the architectural guide. We made up for it with slides, white papers & tribal knowledge, but this Data Mesh book truly captures some of the best practices I saw organziations put into place.It's all here: start with the business goal and work your way back, data product as self-contained unit, the sidecar pattern, embedding policy as code, start small & fast for a big win, iterate, progressively enhance products, govern with provenance & lineage, the changing roles that support this endeavor, operational & analytical systems & the desired intertwingling, + more..We didn't use the term Data Mesh & didn't do everything captured here. The challenge with any vendor is we tend to think of ourselves as the center of the universe. MarkLogic's way to integrate with a larger world of data was Semantics. But #DataMesh provides a higher level of abstraction.The book's just really well done. Technology vendors don't know how to document like this. Vendors focus on their own product's knobs & levers. What they fail to understand & illustrate for their customers is that their particular technology works within a system of technologies to achieve a business goal. It never works alone. So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book. If you can grok the patterns outlined here, you can fill in the gaps with the technology, people & process right for your solution.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale
"Zhamak Dehghani says “Data mesh is what comes after an inflection point, shifting our approach, attitude, and technology toward data. Mathematically, an inflection point is a magic moment at which a curve stops bending one way and starts curving in the other direction. It’s a point that the old picture dissolves, giving way to a new one.” Data Mesh, Chapter 6“A strategic inflection point is a time in the life of a business when its fundamentals are about to change. That change can mean an opportunity to rise to new heights. But it may just as likely signal the beginning of the end. — Andrew S. Grove” Data Mesh, Chapter 6In the Data Mesh book, Zhamak Dehghani does not refer only to the real world practices that reinforce the data mesh theory, but also stands on the generally accepted principles of Systems Thinking. Zhamak Dehghani referred to “Thinking in Systems” for Donnelly H. Meadows while talking about leverage points and feedback loops for maintaining Dynamic Equilibrium.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale

"First of all, I give a 5-star rating on this book, as it is truly an excellent book for those who consider whether to become a quant. This is one of the major objectives the author had for writing this book, so he has clearly done a huge favor to all of us non-quant's, and we should be all thankful for his generous offering of his own valuable experience and knowledge as a domain subject expert in the field, based on his successful career as a quant.For the technical contents, I actually disagree with those other fellow readers who gave a 1-star or 2-star rating. We need to set expectation right that we should not expect that with a book of $20 to $40, we can immediately learn everything about how to build a quantitative trading system to start making money immediately. Instead, we should expect how much this book has added to everyone's existing knowledge base in this field. To me, it's quite significant. I have been following the models and strategies as introduced in

I used to be a physicist long time ago as well, with tons of math learnt and research work done, but jumped to computers two decades ago. One thing that this book helped me settle with myself is that I do not regret that I did not pursue a quant career long time ago, as this book helped convince me that complicated, advanced math doesn't seem to work well with the turbulent markets. In this regard, Warren Buffett remains the best (and maybe one of the few) example of how one can deal with the turbulent markets masterfully  and CONSISTENTLY.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage

The contents of this book are too superficial to be useful. Any quant with a passing familiarity of ml in finance is aware of the techniques covered. Nothing new is said nor is it said in an interesting manner. The author clearly knows the material and is a position to offer some real insights but sadly does not do so. I’m still scratching my head trying to figure out who the target audience is. The book implicitly assumes the reader is familiar with the area but then never delves deeper than that familiarity. With a $45 price tag this book cannot be considered a good value. I’d suggest those interested in this topic to spend their time and money elsewhere.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage
Great book to learn more about investing,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage
"I wanted to like this book. The author has spent several years at SAC (now p72) and Caxton, two first-tier hedge funds. Although neither fund is renowned for their quantitative strategies, this gives Isichenko infinitely more credibility than someone who has learned their trade at institutional asset managers or some minor bank.  And indeed, the book is competent and coherent. Compared, for example, to De Prado's "" 'Advances' in Financial Machine Learning"", you understand what is going on, and the sweeping pronouncements are reduced to a minimum. Some are still there, and I could quibble with them, but that would be focusing on the detail. Let's consider instead the main features of the book. The first three chapters focus on data and forecasting returns. In less than 150 pages, you are treated to linear regression, ensemble methods, model selection, deep learning. I have a basic criticism here. A bit like in the Halperin-Dixon-Bilokon book, this is a compendium of stuff that you could find covered much better in other books. To its merit, this book is shorter and more insightful than the HDB, which was both long, unoriginal and totally detached from finance. Still, you (the reader) will be much better off reading any of: a few chapters of Friedman-Hastie-Tibshirani, the two ""All of Statistics"" by Larry Wasserman or the monumental opus by Kevin Murphy (2nd edition coming! in two volumes). You could argue that it's too much. But these three chapters in Isichenko's book are definitely too little. You won't understand deeply, and if you implement the techniques, you have to study them from scratch anyway. Although (to repeat!) this is better than De Prado, Halperin and other books, I find the little that is finance-specific very superficial and inadequate. The section on covariance cleaning is stuck to Marchenko-Pastur (there is a huge literature on asymptotics of spiked covariance matrices in the past 20 years), and is oblivious to its problems in applications. It is admirable that at least the author talks about signal and portfolio combination; less so that the content is not great. The rest of the book covers finance-specific topics: risk and portfolio construction. But, every topic is treated so superficially to the point of being really useless. Factor models; market impact; performance attribution; the Kelly criterion: all these are ""covered"" at a level that you would receive from reading a survey presentation from Barra or a bank report. Great! Superficiality does not pay off. For example, a lot of signals that work in statistical arbitrage could be described in 3 lines each. *That is not where the value is*. Anyone who has actually worked and implemented factor models or market impact models will tell you it's the experience in implementing these models, and the lessons learned, that really matter.So, three stars. It's a nice pamphlet: it's short, it's clear, but it's awfully generic and superficial as well. As the ""unlikely result of some 20 years of trial-and-error discovery"", as the author writes, it seems a rather disappointing outcome, but I'll leave the final judgement to the author and its readers.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Quantitative Portfolio Management: The Art and Science of Statistical Arbitrage

Thank you for this publication!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics & Statistical Analysis Illustrated: Foundations You Should Know
"I read this while working through statistics courses as a PhD student. I don't have a strong math background, and while I could follow the instructions in the stats books, I was struggling to understand the concepts. This  little booklet is written in a narrative style, that made it easy to follow along and understand. The author frequently repeats charts and graphs, so that you can see how the distribution changes based on changing sampling procedures. It was really helpful in getting my head around some of the fundamentals that I missed along the way, and made me more confident in the interpretation process.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistics & Statistical Analysis Illustrated: Foundations You Should Know

The jump to ML is done way too early,4.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Forecasting in Python
"This book explains the concepts in a non-mathematical way. So, if you do not have a mathematical background then you should be able to follow along. Codes in the book sometimes do not work but if you look at the github page for the book, these errors have been corrected.My biggest problem with the book is that it does not show you how to forecast beyond your dataset. For example, if you have a monthly/weekly dataset ranging from 2010-2022, then this book does not show you how to forecast into the year 2023. All the models (at least the classic models that the book has talked about, I haven't looked at the deep learning ones yet) divide the dataset into training and test data and then show you how the model is performing against the test data. Now, that we know the models are performing well, how about forecasting beyond the test dataset? That part is missing in the book. So, in my opinion the book helps you to understand forecast theory in a non-mathematical way but does not actually show you how to forecast past the test data that you have available. Another negative is that the book repeats a lot of stuff. It seems like the author is justifying the high price of the book with the number of pages (at close to sixty dollars, this book is pretty expensive for what it is trying to teach). So, two stars for the theoretical part and took away three stars for not showing how to forecast past the test dataset.When someone buys a book on forecast, they normally hope to learn how to forecast into the future and not just learn how forecasting works within their available dataset. This book fails miserably in this particular direction.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Forecasting in Python

"It’s a solid book, excellent introduction, and I definitely have a far greater understanding of the various models, and reasoning behind their components.I had hoped for a bit more, but I think the time series model family is just fairly simple in concept and practice — I should be thrilled it’s so simple, but yeah guess I wanted more of an intermediate read.I suppose I feel like I didn’t add much to my toolkit, more so just have a greater understanding of them — hoped for a bit of both.I also bought this pre release when index wasn’t fully formed, so had I read the full index I probably would have realized this pre buy — the fault lies with me there.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Forecasting in Python
"The structure of the book to get one started with concepts, thinking about the time series problem, and analysis makes this unique. Most of the books go after demonstrating the python code rather than trying to put the concepts together and using python examples to illustrate the concepts. The flow charts for decision making are nice and mathematical concepts are clearly explained.  Great Book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Time Series Forecasting in Python

"This book requires some work. By that, I mean you have to tinker with some of the examples because they either contain typos and white space mismatches (which is obviously a no-no with Python), variable name errors left over from the first edition, and required packages that only work with a certain 3.x version of Python that they don’t explicitly communicate. You’ll also be expected to set up your own targets for the scripts you write with very little explanations from the authors. In the grand scheme of things, these drawbacks (and overcoming them to get the examples to work) just reinforce the teaching of a “hacker” mindset in my opinion so it’s not that big a deal.

"A silly movie, with subpar special effects and lots of holes in the plot.  But it is a goofy and funny comedy.  They throw in some gratuitous “erotic’ scenes, I suppose to draw in a certain ticket buyer. The opening scene with the plane was terrible and scenes like that were done better in the 1950's.  The plane flying looked so fake.  Anyway, the plane crashes, releasing a 129' snake, genetically engineered by Biogene, to have the attributes of many different snakes.  And in the movie were a small and one not so small real python which was nice.  There is a deputy (Louis) put in for comedic relief who plays a buffoon.  There is a super real estate salesman and the scene where he is showing the house is full of double entendres.  And of course there is a government team sent to kill the snake, full of confidence and short on brains.  It is really a film for a rainy day.

"I would give this book 2-1/2 stars, if Amazon would let me give half-stars.  It's not ""bad"", it's just focused almost exclusively on cybersecurity *for* *Microsoft* *Windows* systems, and how each example might map back to an attacker goal/technique denoted within the MITRE ATT&CK framework (also, not ""bad"", per se).Python is PLATFORM INDEPENDENT, yet the examples from this book focus on using Python within the Windows execution environment, often requiring various Windows facilities (WMI, autorun, the Windows registry, Windows logging, and the like) that do not exist on Linux systems.  This makes many of the examples irrelevant, as Linux underpins the entire Internet.Chapter 5 - ""Performing Privilege Escalation"" does not demonstrate this topic. It does show how you could inject malicious Python libraries somewhere within your own PYTHONPATH, but does not talk about how this could be used to achieve privilege escalation.Having said all of that, the examples that are provided would seem to work in a Windows environment, and are designed to attack and defend a Windows system.  The book is rather short, but each example seems to deliver on its goal of demonstrating a Windows-based attack and defense using Python - mostly by running a Python library and (very brief/limited) script from within that same Windows system.  (This is know as running an ""agent"" on a protected/targeted device.)  In summation, the book does provide value, but that value is rather lean, Microsoft-Windows centric, agent-based, and couched against definitions laid out by the MITRE Corporation's ""ATT&CK framework"".

"Before buying this book I heard about LPTHW and the ""controversy"" around...but obviously this is the internet and everyone is entitled say whatever they want so I didnt took them seriously.Before reading this book, I've read some C++ concepts in the past (couples of years before) but they were simple as: types, functions, statements.. so nothing complicated, but I went thru this book with a tiny bit of knowledge..At the beginning of the book I was amazed at how much fun I has having and how much better I was starting to understand those concepts (that I was already familiar with).The way the book is structured its extremely good: making your hands dirty immediately it's really the right thing to do for a beginner.It may be obvious for some one but wasn't for me, the fact that you should type everything you see and make it work on your own, and then read and check what is happening. Then type again and again and eventually, even if you don't REALLY understand the DEEPER MEANING of everything, you are still a step further to getting closer.So everything was going fine and I was eager to go to the next lesson...Till chapter 43 when he introduces the Class/Object..I honestly went back on it a couple of times but every time I felt that there was something different... somethings has changed from before... there was no more fun, no more understanding.. but just: DO IT AS I DO AND SHUT UP.There was little room for exploration as he presented a semi-empty script with empty classes  that you should fill as he would... oh and yea he just introduced you to what a class is like.. so good luck with that.You pass from ITS A, HAS A type of explanation to complete an already started script of several different classes with subclasses and inherits.. wtf? I've felt like I jumped 2 chapters...It was challenging? absolutely but it wasn't fun... it wasn't discovering new things... it was desperation of trying to solve this exercises because you know that classes are an important topic...And from there, it just got worst...At chapter 47 you are introduced to an another fundamental topic: TESTS.So as usual you start typing and typing and installing modules, you will get excited of all of this new stuff you will learn about... but you will be WRONG... because as soon as you finish he says:GO ON INTERNET AND FIND OUT HOW TO USE AND INSTALL EVERYTHING YOU JUST DID.....W.T.F... it took me a day to find out in the nose manual that their syntax was the same as unittest but just spelled with the format snake_case...As a beginner, and as I have never seen what an test/assert_equal is, I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED A BIT OF EXPLANATION before sending me online..I had to go online and search for OTHER people tutorial about something that I was suppose to learn in this book... WTF AGAIN...And from here honestly I just lost interest... he doesn't show anymore the ""what you should"" see section so you are left on your own... If you don't understand: too bad... If you do understand but misunderstand also too bad... For me was harder trying to understand what HE will have me to do rather than the code itself...At the end of the book you will do automatic tests of his text game and deploy it online so he introduces some HTML concepts but honestly I just didn't care anymore and never finished.. and here brings me the major flaw about zed in my opinion.He states at the beginning that he doesn't want you to teach everything, but he wants you to be autonomous and be able to understand what to search bla bla... Ok! its a good mentality! But there is a problem.. programming concepts are so deep and so many (even for a subject alone).. that you NEED at least something information to start and only then LEAVE THE REST TO YOU if you want more info...Again: if I have to leave the beginner's book to search other tutorials for beginners to understand what has written in my beginner's book... I think that the book failed to do part of his job...I then IMMEDIATELY went to PYTHON CRASH COURSE and things just pop out like flowers in spring... and it was because of how zed open my view of how to take a programming book..So I recommend this book even despite the BIG disappointment of the last chapters, because I truly think that this book teaches you the discipline that you will absolutely need to start every other book.. but be aware you will not become a expert programmer after just this book... buy this together with PYTHON CRASH COURSE and think of them as one lesson.. typing (LPTHW) and understanding (PCC)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"I consider myself somewhat intelligent. I have done some prior coding. I wanted to enhance my skills by putting coding on my resume. So that should tell you a bit about who i am and what I am seeking. I bought the book knowing that the title says ""the hard way "" in it.. Reading some of the book and looking at reviews I thought this is something I can handle.I think the book is excellent up to a certain point and then goes off the deep end. What I mean by this is that it starts out at a basic level teaching the reader how to install python and also how to write simple functions and such. great stuff and I like the approach. Then.. all of a sudden it jumps into OOP and starts talking about things I cannot follow. I did the exerecises and read over and over and still find it jumping from entry level to very advanced stuff. so.. given the context of the subject matter, the title indicates this is done the ""hard way"" but in the title there is also a phase that indicates this is a very simple introduction to the world of computers and code.. I think when we write or sell and instruction book, we need to stay at the level it is intended and consider the buyer and the level of his skills and STICK with that concept. I seriously doubt you can write a book which has the intent of teaching Python from the ground up and then jump off into OOP. I would have preferred to kept going with basic programming and then bought a more advanced book when I felt the need. Sorry.. half the book is a waste of my time. I was going to give this rating a 1 but consider the good value in the first half of the book. I'll keep it as a reference. But.. it could have been done differently.***************************I added some more comments here.. I went back to the book to redo the lessons.. I do find the manner of typing all the code very helpful and intuitive. it works to reinforce the material. I changed the review to 4 stars.. I still feel the section on OOP is out of context.. I'm keeping this book as a good reference place to actually write code and practice writing",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)

"It's a decent book. I also read his previous version with python2, however its all or more the same. He defines the ""hard way"" as typing things in yourself, which I actually like. However outside of this, he leaves a lot of guessing and doesn't do the best job at explaining things. Hell, in exercise 40 he even states that ""Keep in mind that I’m giving you a slightly inaccurate idea of how these work so that you can start to build up an understanding of classes "". So he really takes a roundabout way into topics, and leaves a lot of open ended things from the students perspective. You will do many exercises without explanation and the reassurance that ""we will explain this later, don't worry, but just type in the code and trust me"".Wouldn't recommend this book to most learners, there are better options out there. A lot of these other reviews are accurate.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"Shaw's ""hard way"" is the way that I learned to code as an 8-year-old in the early '90s, and the way that my dad learned to code in the '70s. It means that you type in code, character-by-character, from what is printed in the book, not necessarily fully understanding what it's going to do or why. Then, once you have it working, there is an explanation of how the code works. Basically rote memorization drills paired with learning the associated concepts. It can be tedious at times, but it works well.This book is absolutely appropriate for someone with no coding experience. Someone who has learned a language before will probably already be familiar with many of the concepts, but it's still ok if you are willing to tolerate a little bit that.The drawback for me is that a big portion of the book has you writing small Zork-style games in order to practice the skills that you're learning. It's just not something that I am interested in at all, and I've had a little bit of trouble pushing my way through that stuff.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"I've tried multiple tutorials from multiple sources (Udemy, Lynda, Tuts+, Codecademy, YouTube, etc.), but none of them compare to the LP3THW method.  You'll get your hands dirty right away by diving straight into the exercises from the very beginning.  You're not bogged down with a ton of theory up front.  Instead the theory is gradually revealed as you progress through each exercise.  Unfortunately there is one down side, if you want the accompanying videos, you will still need to purchase directly from his website.  The Kindle version doesn't provide access to any of the online videos.  I know many reviewers wrote negative reviews because of this, but it's how Zed has things set up.  When you purchase LP3THW directly from Zed's website, you will be able to get any and all updates related to that purchase, including any new videos.  And for those who seem to think Zed has a bad attitude when it comes to teaching, they fail to understand that he clearly states in one of his lessons, it's his goal to ensure that his students can move forward into a PROGRAMMING environment without the need of his ongoing help.  I mean, that is the whole point of learning to program, isn't it?",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
If this will be the only resource you have then it is not a good way to learn Python. It requires lots of supplementation even when using the accompanying videos on the publisher's website. This book is good for getting a feel for coding the extremely simple stuff but doesn't place emphasis on what you should be calling things except in a few fringe cases. Once you get to exercise 43 the book is basically useless because it expects you to already be able to code object-oriented programming (OOP) somehow but also has barely even explained it.As a beginner in order to complete the exercise in the manner prescribed in the book you will have to look up tons of external material in order to learn OOP which effectively makes the book pointless at that point since it isn't teaching you anything.It really feels like there were supposed to be more exercises before exercise 43 but constraints or laziness prevented the author from adding them.That said for an absolute beginner it is fine from exercise 1 - 42 as long as you supplement with outside material such as youtube videos in order to actually learn what the book is trying to teach you.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)
"I don't like how often the book says ""Look {this} up online."" If this is going to be a teaching method in the book, they could at least point me toward a site that provides reliable, up to date information (Yes, I know this is difficult in print because websites change). I bought this book to teach me the material, not to tell me to look things up online. They could give a brief definition, so that at least when you look something up online you can verify that the online source agrees with the book, and is just providing more detail.The author also uses built in python methods without explaining what they are. I'm coming from c++, where generally if a function is called it is explicitly written somewhere, so I was searching back through the book looking to see if it was written somewhere I missed. I finally looked it up online. Since the author likes to use ""Look this up online,"" as a teaching method, ""Look up {this} built in python method"" online would have been helpful.Other than what I consider unacceptable missing information, I like the style of the book and it is very easy to understand and follow. I hate python, and I wish I didn't have to learn it, but the book makes learning it pretty enjoyable.",3.0 out of 5 stars,Learn Python 3 the Hard Way: A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code (Zed Shaw's Hard Way Series)

There are spelling errors, mistakes in console output (random python code in command output), a ton of totally unnecessary personal stories (Sorry Alfredo, we don’t need to know why the CTO was always a jerk), and most concerningly the technical content is not up to par.They try to cover too many areas and lack depth. They clearly don’t know what an ASIC is when stating that a GPU is a type of ASIC (in that case, so is a CPU), their “encryption” section includes hashing (not encryption) and recommends md5 for password hashing and handrolled RSA from a library which is literally called “hazardous materials”, with zero notice that these are terrible ideas that nobody should use.I’m not finished but this is only worth a skim for some useful library mentions.

This book reads like a collection of somewhat unrelated tips. There are very few motivating examples. I don't think the authors read each others chapters.

"This book claims to be ' A complete guide to learning Python basics..'. It basically identifies Data Types, control statements and Python functions without, in my opinion, showing clearly how they are used in Pythom programming. Also the book is quite baffling in it's descriptions.As an example, under the heading 'Rule of Immutability' it starts by saying ' There are exceptions to the immutability rule in Python' - should it not start by explaining  the Rule of Immutabilty ? (It never seems to do so). The same paragraph ends with 'As a result, while the value of Immutable objects could be modified, the value of their constituent objects can.

"""In the Beginning"" is a good first introduction to the history of the Pythons. The book narrative is quite brief and doesn't cover anything of consequence that can't be found in ""The Pythons."" But the latter is a big, expensive book. This book is like a synopsis, containing the highlights but not much more. The DVD provides some interesting information in its interviews of the Python cast and includes clips from The 1948 Show, Do Not Adjust Your Set, How to Irritate People, etc. While these entire series are available, one can get the essence of what these earlier series (in which various of the Python cast members appeared) were about by watching the DVD.This is not what you want to buy if you already own everything remotely associated with the Pythons.

"While this book is a great resource for Python scripting in ArcGIS, it's more of an introductory desk reference. The backcover touts that there are example datasets and exercises. The book mainly goes over sample code to explain different features of ArcPy but there really wasn't too much in the way of hands on tutorial within the book. It's basically a broad overview of scripting to get you started. For me, this was great because I already had in mind what I wanted out of scripting and have some knowledge of the Python language. The book is helpful in orienting me in the right direction.I did use another resource, the eBook version of

However, if you're a tactile learner (like me), get under the hood and get your hands dirty with Jennings.  Get to where you can comfortably do these exercises.  And then dive into the why's and wherefore's behind them in the Zandbergen text.Yes, I am a ""shoot first, and ask questions later"" type of guy.  Jennings' text lets me dive in.

"To sum it up in one sentence, this book is an excellent reference for caring for the longest living snake, one I give a solid 5 stars. To elaborate, this is the book anyone should start reading if they want to begin understanding the reticulated python and its care. I've been learning a lot from this book and other sources as well, as the reticulated python is a dream species for me to own and interact with. For example, three types of retic (as I will refer to them) exist. Mainland, dwarf, and super dwarf. Dwarf and superdwarf retics are fairly small compared to the giants on mainland Asia that reach 20+ feet. This is due to limited space, genetics, and other factors. Dwarf retics generally max out at 15 feet for a dwarf retic and 10 feet for particularly large super dwarfs based on which islands they come from. The smaller the island, the smaller the reticulated python, and some, like those from tiny Karompa Island, don't get bigger than 7 feet as adults. These smaller retics are the ones I want to work with as pets, as I know my limits with the size of the snakes I can safely own. As I also know some breeders specialize in super dwarf retics, there are options on where to obtain these miniature retics. Reticulated pythons are not aggressive, but it should be noted that they are very smart and food-motivated snakes. This book teaches you some tips on how to showcase you are not a threat or offering food, and how to safely interact with a retic of any size. The book goes over the safest way to let them know you are a friend to trust, through tap training, positive reinforcement, and more. Beyond this, the book showcases the many different color morphs that retics display, and new color morphs are created all the time, so there's no limit to their beauty. This book also talks about enclosures for Reticulated pythons, not to mention treating health issues, caring for them, and breeding them. Combining this with research you do yourself is something that will help you in the event you want to try raising these beautiful snakes yourself, but be prepared for lots of interactions; these are active, strong animals, and they like to explore, so you'll definitely want to let them out under supervision to get some mental stimulation, because these snakes should not spend every day in a terrarium alone. Some places also have bans on keeping reticulated pythons, so do your homework, because some areas won't let you keep them, often for the fact that on very rare occasions they can be dangerous due to their size and strength (an unfortunate prejudice against these reptiles, especially since dogs and cats cause more incidents involving serious injuries than pet pythons ever have). This is also a snake that should be interacted with every other day as an adult at least, and the costs of keeping a large retic are significant. Can you afford this snake? Can you afford its enclosure? Its food? Its veterinary care when it needs it? Perhaps this book can help you figure that out. It certainly is for me. Combined with talking to retic breeders and owners, this book is an excellent step on my path to one day becoming a responsible super dwarf retic owner. I hope it can help do the same for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Reticulated Pythons: A complete guide to care and husbandry

"If you are not on a Mac - disregard this review.  Windows is likely much more forgiving.If you are on a Mac and feel comfortable having your kid run Minecraft and Python under an admin account (yours, most likely) - disregard this review.If you are relaxed about security on your Mac - disregard this review.If you want an opinion on the teaching value of this book, look at other reviews.Still here?OK, the main problem is that Mac files can be very sensitive to the ownership of the files.  Normally, that is not really a problem, you install a program and it goes under Applications and everyone can use it.  This is not really the case here, only the person doing the installation can use it without tweaking.  And the tweaking is NOT easy to do.On to the actual issues...(note:  I have posted fairly detailed steps corresponding to what I did to get it work as an Amazon product discussion on this book's page.)Step #3 - installing Java Development KitThe author tells you to install Java.  This is both unnecessary and risky.  Java on a Mac installs itself as Java + the Java web plugin.  The Java web plugin consistently has security problems and savvy web users tend to disable it whenever possible.  Additionally, once installed, a Mac's Java install does not allow removal of Java itself and makes it very difficult to disable the web plugin for other users (despite being an admin).Minecraft's authors have recognized the problems Java install cause and bundle their own Java embedded in their files.  All the install instructions had to tell you was to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to Minecraft's own Java.Presto, no more need to install Java itself.  I did that, but not before again installing the #@!^& Java as per the instructions.  Thanks for having me saddled with an unpleasant security risk.Step #4 - Installing The Minecraft Python API and Spigot.You know that MinecraftTools Mac.zip file you downloaded?  The one from sourceforge which takes 10-20 minutes to download because it's so slow?Wherever you extract it, its owner will be you.  In Mac terms, that means your kid, if running under his own account rather than yours, is not authorized to read those files.  That's even if you put them under the Shared user.  Easy to see, just look at the files under Finder, press command+I and check the Sharing and Permissions.To run this stuff, you need Read, Write, Execute access.  Your own user has it - your kid and everyone else doesn't.There is a solution, but it is not pleasant.  First you create a new usergroup in the Mac, then, for all the files you extracted, you assign the same rights as the owner to that group.  Finally you make your kid a member of the group.Step 1. Minecraft.Turns out that, strangely enough, the Minecraft program itself can have these permission issues.  That's unusual, I've never seen a Mac application that installs with this problem, but there it was.  You can google up """"Minecraft + El Capitan + Legacy Java"" and find the issue on Mac Support forums.  The fix was the same as before for me, assign the owner's right to the group.Now, this one is definitely not the author's responsibility.  More Minecraft's.If you install the stuff for this book under an admin user and then let your kid run it directly under that user, none of these problems likely show up. Except for the unnecessary Java installation.If, like me, you have your kids set up with their own, unprivileged, account then it is likely you will have the same problems as me.  Unix and Mac permissions are tricky, but essential to get right if you want to share data between users.I do this kinda of work for a living and it wasn't too hard to fix things, only took me 4-5 hours to understand what was going on.  Part of what slowed me down is it was an old Mac, just reformatted to use El Capitan, so I was missing all my regular diagnostic utilities.  Still, I just don't think the installation instructions are good enough for Mac users.Suggestion to author:  include a link within the book to detailed installation instructions online.  Don't try to cover all the bases in the book itself, too complicated.  But do set up such a help site - it's too bad that such a useful teaching book can be so difficult to install.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python
"As a professional software developer, I have to say that this is one of the best introductory level programming books I’ve ever seen. It tells kids just what they need to know to understand what they’re doing, and they get the immediate reward of seeing the action carried out in the game. It consistently links the lessons to results in the game, making it easy to stick with.It’s printed in full color so the code has syntax highlighting and images from the game to illustrate what it’s doing. Python was a good choice for the language to use, as it’s easy to learn and was created with the goal of being easy to understand by anyone.I got this for my son, who is 11, and loves Minecraft. He’s already done a fair amount to customize things himself and was very excited to take that further. I think this book is appropriate for any kid with the attention span and interest to try it out. The constant reward of seeing their work pay off will give them the excitement and confidence to drive them forward.They will need help from time to time, but even if you yourself don’t have experience programming, the book is very clear and should give you what you need to walk them through it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python
"I found out why my server was not connecting to the game.  If you followed all directions from the book and you find that Minecraft Multiplayer says that it ""can not connect to server"" try the following. (It might solve your problem.  It did for me.)Step 1: Open MinecraftStep 2:  Change your Profile (this is in the bottom left corner of the screen).  Click on Edit Profile.Step 3: Change Profile Name to ""Spigot 1.9.2"" or ""Spigot - Python 1.9.2"" (You decide what name you want, I always put the game version in the name.  It is easier for me to keep track with which version I am having to playing with)Step 4: Under ""Version Selection"" click the box that says ""Allow use of  old ""Alpha"" Minecraft Versions""(a box will pop up, click ""yes"")Step 5: Now select the ""release 1.9.2"" (You need this release because the Spigot version is for 1.9.2. This applies to any server you use.)Step 6: Save ProfileStep 7: You will select this Profile you created every time you want to play on this server.If you are not sure if which version of Minecraft spigot is running on, run your Spigot server.  Now on the server screen, scroll up all the way to the top and one of the top few lines should read ""Starting Minecraft server version +++++.""  This is how you find which version of Minecraft you need to set your profile for.I hope this helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python
"Many reviews on this book say that it is outdated and doesn't work with Minecraft. It is true that the setup instructions are outdated, in that they refer to old, unsupported versions of software, and that the author's own distribution of the software is old. However, all the programming exercises work fine if you just ignore the setup instructions and download the newest versions of needed software yourself from the official sources (which is what I would recommend anyway): Java, Python, py3minepi, Minecraft, Spigot server, and the RaspberryJuice plugin for Spigot server. The setup depends on having a client component (py3minepi) loaded into Python that talks to a server API component (RaspberryJuice) in Spigot server. If none of that made sense to you, this book probably isn't for you.I'm a professional software developer with a 7-year-old son who said he wanted to try coding. While the content is clear and easy to understand, I still think he's too young for this book.

"I teach programming to kids. Although this book is advertised as a beginner book for kids with no programming experience, I think it works better as an advanced book after they have learned some basic Python programming from a book like No Starch Press’ Python For Kids by Jason Briggs. I am really impressed by the quantity of material that this book covers, though. Lots of mods that you can write using Python that I would never even think of. It is unlikely that anybody would ever do all of the projects in this book. Better to pick and choose the more interesting ones.It’s true as other reviewers have said that setting up the programming environment is tricky. I found that the best and easiest is to install PyCharm Edu and the raspberryjam mod for Minecraft Forge. Then you don’t need to run the Spigot Minecraft server. You do development inside the mcpipy directory in your .minecraft directory, which avoids the need to install the out-of date py3minepi package (Python 3 Minecraft pi edition API)",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python
"I like the book, so far. My only complaint is with the Kindle formatting of the python code on an iPad. The code looks fine on my Kindle Paperwhite, but when I try to read the code on my iPad (where I can view it much larger) the python code is sometimes unreadable. For instance, in the very first examples of using python the code appears to read "">>> 2  2+"" instead of "">>> 2 + 2"". Other examples are even more difficult. Changing the font didn't seem to help.Other than that, I was able to install all the Mac Tools and get everything working on the first try. There are complaints here about the included Spigot Minecraft server not being compatible with the latest Minecraft release, but there's no way that the author can keep up with the release schedule of Mojang. Simply choose to run the Minecraft version (in the Minecraft Launcher) that matches the latest Spigot server that you are running.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Learn to Program with Minecraft: Transform Your World with the Power of Python

"(This review is based on the first edition.) If you are a scientist used to coding in other languages, and want to get the flavor of Python, this little book is an easy and pleasant way to begin. It would also be a great textbook for a one-semester introduction to coding aimed at students who have taken calculus. The price point is great (only $25) and the design of the book is lovely, a LaTeX tour de force for which the designer, as well as Princeton University Press, deserve considerable praise.An earlier reviewer compared this book unfavorably to Mark Newman's ""Computational Physics,"" which I think is unfair.

I am so very happy to have found this book - I purchased the kindle version within minutes of finding it (the paper version is not available for another month) - I just knew this would be a great book.  My hunch was right -  I love this book!  I have been on and off using Python for at least 6 or 7 years as needed for scientific computing.  I have perused many of the most popular Python books and purchased a good many.  What usually happens is I lose interest quickly and never finish the book.  But this book seems different.  It is written in a very clear language and gets right to the point of programming with Python and uses the latest packages such as Anaconda or Enthought Canopy with focus on numpy and matplotlib.  I really like the style of the book and the content.  The level is for beginning programmers (which I am not) but suitable for intermediate and advanced programmers for sure.

However, Python has now come to dominate many aspects of astronomy, and I've been looking for a quick, direct route to Python that would tell me exactly what I needed to know without dwelling on basic material I had already learned.  This book is like sitting down at the keyboard with a really good Python mentor.  I worked all of the exercises, and found them both useful and surprisingly interesting.  The only shortcoming I found was in describing a way to open a data file, write columns of data to it with a header, and close it.  Including a few paragraphs about fileData = open(), fileData = write(), and fileData = close() would have been really helpful.  However, this information isn't well documented in the sources I've checked, so I didn't take off a point for this.  I'm happy to give this book my strong recommendation.

You get to use a very simple and consistent syntax to perform these steps.2. Extracting features from date-time, text and time series data is very easy with the tools given in this book3. Finally creating new features such as splines, polynomials and periodic features is made easy.What is missing in this book is feature selection though it is covered in the feature-engine library.

"This book covers a variety of feature engineering techniques for machine learning students, practitioners, and professionals. As a ""Cookbook"", the manual surveys data transformations that a user might like to perform in order to generate numerical features from numerical, categorial, text, or other sorts of data, and presents the core software libraries and functions that implement those transformations. Each chapter has a straight-to-the-point structure: technical requirements for the datasets, python libraries, and core functions used in the chapter's exercises, followed by a ""How to do it"" section with easy-to-follow python code, followed by a ""How it works"" section describing the techniques at a more conceptual level.The book covers a number of advanced topics that are of interest to a variety of users, including Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Yeo-Johnson transformation, and decision-tree discretization/feature combinations. The suite of tools provided by the `feature-engine` library seems tremendously useful for wrapping many of these methods into easy-to-use routines. Some feature normalization techniques like Mahalanobis/ZCA or ICA whitening are surprisingly not covered. The cursory discussion of frequency-domain data representations makes some sense given the authors' focus on nonperiodic variables like debt and stock prices, but some coverage of these techniques would have been nice, as would a discussion of e.g. deep learning for feature induction.Although outside the scope of a cookbook like this, it would have been useful to see some discussion of benefits and drawbacks to each method, especially from the point of view of their relation to inferential statistics, else how train/validation/test routines might need to be adapted to features obtained through such imputation/transformation.

"Not sure I understand many of the other reviews.  Yes, you can learn some Python by using this book but there are several issues with this book.  First off, it contains a fair number of typographical errors that you're going to have to catch, and resolve, on your own.  Second, and perhaps more important, the author does keep things pretty minimalist.  What I'm getting at is the book is less than 100 pages and the explanation of things is sometimes nonexistent.  For example, he introduces the Panda function but really provides no explanation for the purpose of the function before having you just start typing in code and using the function.  Basically you're left on your own to figure out a lot things  The title of this book implies that it's for beginners but, given the missing explanations, I don't think that's true.  I've been involved in the computer industry for several decades (some of which involved coding Windows in the C language) and studied a variety of languages including assembler, C, Cobol, Basic, Fortran, JavaScript, and some rudimentary Python programming.So far I haven't gotten to the part about machine learning but at this point I'm about halfway through the book.

The classic book on natural language processing by the folks who built the NLTK library.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"Edward Loper's book is an introduction to the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for the Python programming language.  Its target audience is a narrow one.  It assumes a working familiarity with Python.  It's true that an experienced programmer could learn Python along the way, but getting the most from the code examples and walkthrough explanations requires enough familiarity to ""think"" in Python.  The book also assumes sufficient familiarity with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand why one would want to build lexicons, grammars, and parsers.The book has several strengths.  It is tightly integrated with Python and NLTK code.  There are numerous examples throughout and the author walks through and modifies them to clarify how the NLTK works.  The sizeable reference sections at the end of each chapter are also valuable.  These sections include both introductory and advanced sources.  And a lot of them.  There is also useful integration with the NLTK web site which provides and points to additional resources.Not to be missed are the end-of-chapter questions.  Readers have come to expect little from these learning aids; they usually invite us to parrot back a small number of key concepts or try a few calculations or code segments.  This book's questions go far beyond the norm.  They introduce new concepts, encourage writing and comparing several versions of a program, and otherwise extend each chapter's contents.  Even readers who don't plan to complete these exercises should read them closely.Weaknesses are few.  As noted, the book may assume too much Python and NLP background for some users.  It does have a narrow focus and is not organized the right way to be used as a reference book.  Readers who want something a little more modular and reference-like might prefer Jacob Perkins'

"If you already know what's in this book, it's probably a great book.  But if you don't, it's not.I've been programming in C and C++ for around 15 years.  I taught computer science at Stanford.  I write crosswords for the New York Times.  Neither programming nor language is new to me.  But I found it very difficult (nigh on impossible) to learn anything from this book.  I couldn't learn about NLTK effectively, and I couldn't learn about Python, either.  I bought the book to learn both; imagine my disappointment!In both cases, the reason is that the book is organized from a ""let's do this, let's do that"" perspective.  If you want to do exactly what the authors did, that's great.  But if you want to do something different, it's terrible.  As a representative example, exercise 2.8.13 mentions, ""You can get all noun synsets using wn.all_synsets('n').""That's great to know.  But why is the only indication of a piece of useful functionality sitting inside an exercise?  There needs to be a well thought-out layout: ""Here are all the pieces of NLTK.  Here is what each piece does.  Here is what the submethods are and how they work.""  As it stands, if I want to do something new, I have to either write it myself or just guess as to whether it's functionality that NLTK provides.The treatment of python is sadly similar.  Python depends heavily on something called a ""list comprehension"".  List comprehensions are used throughout the book.  But their syntax, from a programming perspective, is never defined.  Having read (and reread) much of this book, I can say with confidence that I still don't understand how they work.  Given my programming background, I would think I would have a much better understanding having spent so much time trying to figure it out.Again, there needs to be structure.  ""This is what's in Python.  This is what it all means, one piece at a time.""You can find this book online for free; I read it that way the first time, got confused, and figured buying a paper copy would help.  Sadly, it didn't.",2.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"Buy this book only if you:  1. Know the basics of natural language processing (NLP) or linguistics;  2. Know the Python programming language or you're willing to learn it;  3. Are using the NLTK library or plan to do so.NLTK is a Python library that offers many standard NLP tools (tokenizers, POS taggers, parsers, chunkers and others). It comes with samples of several dozens of text corpora typically used in NLP applications, as well as with interfaces to dictionary-like resources such as WordNet and VerbNet. No FrameNet, though. NLTK is well documented, so you might not need this book initially. However, it definitely helps to have it on your desk if you are serious about using NLTK.The first chapters are a bit messy, as they attempt to introduce all three themes (NLP, NLTK and Python) together. Beginners may have some difficulty sorting things out. By the time you reach the WordNet section, you either got lost in the forest, realize that you would never understand this topic without the book, or both. However, if you are a bit patient and try out all simple code examples, you'll make it eventually. In my opinion, NLTK remains the simplest, most elegant and well rounded library of its kind.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"NLTK was originally designed for teaching NLP, but because NLTK is so comprehensive, it is also quite vast, and you will need a guide to get you started on using it effectively. This book is that guide. Its organized into 4 sections. Chapters 1-4 cover the basics; 5-7 covers language processing, tagging, classification and information extraction; Chapters 8-10 covers sentence parsing, syntax, structure and representations of meaning, and Chapter 11 covers managing linguistics data. If you are looking to get an overview of NLP, as well as reasonable proficiency in manipulating text and extracting information from it, this book may be for you. People who are not NLP specialists but need to use NLP techniques at work will find this book particularly helpful. People who plan on specializing in NLP will probably find the book useful as a stepping stone into the field.My interest in NLP (and the book) is limited to being able to apply machine learning techniques to solve NLP problems, so I found the first two sections really useful. However, the entire book (including the exercises) is a great source of ideas on what you can accomplish in NLP with NLTK.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit
"My subject area background when I picked up this book was NLP 101, Python 201. Halfway through the book, I can say I am at NLP 201, Python 301. I really like the example-driven approach. It motivates me to write Python modules operating in a similar fashion to the examples but with heuristic changes (wherever applicable). It is a good journey of discovery and reinforcement of NLP concepts via a DIY approach. I do find that relatively complex concepts sneak up on you as you get deeper in the book. But you can always google for literature on areas, which do not have exhaustive coverage. And there is a decent amount of literature easily and/or freely available. Tip - it really helps to know your probability and statistics theory. To summarize, this book has sustained and grown my interest in NLP - an area with amazing opportunities and possibilities. And Python is a really elegant language. Thank you Steven Bird and team!",4.0 out of 5 stars,Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit

"As a longtime fan of Monty Python, I was thrilled to get my hands on the 4K Ultra HD version of ""The Meaning of Life"". And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.First of all, the picture quality is outstanding. The vibrant colors and crisp details bring the absurdity of Monty Python's humor to life in a way that I've never seen before. Every scene, from the gross-out ""Mr. Creosote"" sketch to the bizarre ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" musical number, looks like it was shot yesterday.But the real star of the show is, of course, the comedy. ""The Meaning of Life"" is a series of sketches that explore everything from birth to death, with plenty of detours along the way. There are moments of biting satire, ridiculous slapstick, and even some surprisingly touching moments.As always, the Python troupe is on top form. The late Graham Chapman is particularly memorable as the host of the ""Galaxy Song"" sequence, while John Cleese delivers one of the funniest speeches in the history of cinema as the pompous headmaster in the ""Live Organ Transplants"" sketch.Of course, this being Monty Python, the humor isn't for everyone. If you're easily offended or put off by crude jokes and irreverent humor, ""The Meaning of Life"" probably isn't for you. But if you're a fan of absurdist comedy and British humor, you owe it to yourself to check this out.Overall, I can't recommend ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" on 4K Ultra HD enough.

"...a Python fan since about twelve, I vividly remember this film coming out when I was thirteen or so.  I loved it.  It's great that it has not only held up but, like fine wine, it has gotten better with age.  Maybe Terry Gilliam's right when he says, in one of the commentaries, that, today, comedy's standard is so low that ""our crap seems good no.""  But it reveals their genius in so many ways.  It reveals a confidence they clearly didn't feel--as tho' they'd gotten their sea legs--in the first two efforts.  Though ""Brian"" is their supreme achievement, I have to say that this film must be placed ahead of ""Holy Grail""--which given its budget looks distincly like badly shot TV.  Hysterically funny, but the budget limits are are even more glaring in a high res medium like DVD.In ""Meaning of Life"" the entire cast are masters of the medium (something Cleese proved independently in ""A Fish Called Wanda"") and they use their skills, rising even to lyrical heights (Eric Idle's paen to the universe in ""Live Organ Transplants"").  And the effects are more hysterical twenty years later.This movie is also remarkable for the rather bitter satire of American pop culture.  Heretofore, the Python's had stayed within the classic tradition of British comedy--filled with whimsy and just plain silliness and the class structure.  American humor is generally either observational or political--and these days it almost entirely the latter.  Even the masters of observation, Goldberg and Carlin, have abandoned it for bitter political diatribes attacking former fans like myself in the basest terms because out political beliefs differ.And it follows, as it should, that the movie's best skits are the ones true to their tradition.  George Harrison once called Python the continuation of the Beatles (to the point of chipping in $8M for distribution and advertising for ""Brian""!).  And, especially in the all too brief Gilliam animations, this is completely accurate.  Without being at all derivative, they capture the whimisical sensibility the Beatles had updated and transformed and ran with it.One draw back is the rather low-rent 5.1 remix.  I've other films--e.g. the Godfather films--which are older than have far better jobs.  So don't expect much.  In fact, you might even consider using the 2CH option as the remixing engineer makes little use of the rear speakers.That gentle bitch aside, the deleted scenes are mixed (why on Earth Jones thought anyone would want to see more of Mr. Creosote is beyond me?) and clearly wisely hit the cutting room floor (especially the horrendously unfunny Martin Luther skit), but some the commentary by Jones and Gilliam--clearly done at different times and mixed--is interesting most especially for the bitterness of Gilliam's attitude.  It has been so on the two preceding films, but it's much more intense on this one.The brief interview segments shows the group rivalry is still a hot issue in the guys' psyches, nearly twenty years after Graham Chapman's tragic death ended the group; they are still bickering.  Gilliam's comments about Cleese are particularly acid; Cleese does he usual job of insulting nearly everyone.  He is returned the favor by the rest of the group, tho' Jones slyly does it with the most class and thus does it the best.  Cleese, after all, easily slips into insufferable.  Hence his brilliance as Basil Fawlty.A reluctant four star due only to the ****-poor 5.1 remix.  The studio, surprise, surprise, didn't want to spend any extra money getting a good one.The movie itself: 5 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Monty Python's The Meaning of Life
"""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film from the iconic comedy troupe Monty Python. The film is a series of skits and musical numbers that satirize various aspects of life and society, such as religion, sex, and death. The film is divided into seven segments, each dealing with a different stage of life.The humor in the film is irreverent, absurd, and often tasteless, but it is also clever, witty and highly original. The film features some of Monty Python's most memorable sketches, such as the ""Fish slap dance"" and the ""Catholic schoolboys"" skit. The musical numbers are also noteworthy, including the catchy ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" and ""The Galaxy Song.""The Meaning of Life is a film that is not for everyone, as it is not afraid to push boundaries and tackle taboo subjects. But for fans of Monty Python and for those who enjoy offbeat and unconventional comedy, it is a must-see. It is a movie that will make you laugh, think and question the meaning of life in a hilarious and irreverent way.Overall, ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" is a classic comedy film that has stood the test of time.

"I'm not sure why this book got some bad reviews, because it will get you up and running with python. No, it won't make a programmer out of an absolute beginner, you need Chris Pine's 'Learn to Program' for that. But if you want a palatable and informative overview of Python, and how to work it, this book will do the trick.I got into Python because of the Raspberry Pi, but most Pi books treat Python in a pretty cursory manner. Yes, you'll be able to write ""hello world"" and put up a function or two, but if you really want to know what's under the hood you need more info. However, you don't need it served up in 1600 pages as one other introductory text attempts to do.Like most Dummy books, this one covers a pretty wide range of topics and does so in a fairly organized and presentable manner. Because there are so many headings (those 'clever' Dummy headings!!) you can flip and browse around in the book to your heart's content to get what you need. And the index, the bane of too many modern books, is a useful one.4/9/14- (An added note about the examples- they are very terse, sometimes only a line long, but if you look at the near-by text you can find the missing lines in other examples. You just need to stitch them together. ANother thing, sometimes important information is buried in a short, non-descript sentence that is easy to over look. If you are skimming, skim the text carefully!)The examples are short, apparently some folks don't like them, but I found they gave me the commands and syntax I needed in easy to find format. Personally I don't like the way the code is set off on grey blocks, it makes them easy to spot, but the reduced contrast and small type is hard on older eyes. It's a minor quibble, and its' a consistent style with Dummy books, part of their look.I was struggling with Python before I got this book, mainly from a lack of information. A couple hours with this book at the keyboard and the difference is night and day.

I have previous experience with programming languages, although this is not my everyday task. I got interested in Python and wanted the book to guide me through the basics. After reading the first 7-8 chapters I started asking myself whether I missed something in the previous ones, as I lost track (and interest) in the book.I found the examples parsed in the chapters rather useless, and not practical. Since, I have found several useful on-line tutorials on [...] where the user is taken through the chapters in a gradual, progressive way. The examples and exercises in a beginner's book should be based on what is learned in the previous chapters, giving the reader the idea that what is learned is put in practice, thus easily assimilated.I don't recommend this book for a complete novice, as she/he will lose interest in Python programming very easily! This book has the advantage of presenting the main and most important features of the Python programming language, but it sues a more advanced audience.The low rating is indeed due to the non adequacy of the book for beginners and for not following the good standards of the ""...for dummies"" successful series.Sacha",2.0 out of 5 stars,Python For Dummies
"I found this book to be a good learning tool to learn Python having already had at least some experience with programming. The only problem I have with it is that because it was published in 2006, some of the material is dated and I found that I had to look up how some pieces of code have changed with the new versions of Python. Besides that, as long as you have at least some experience with Python then this book should benefit you. If you are new to programming, then there is a different Python for Dummies book that would be of more use to you.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Python For Dummies

"I wanted to pick up programming as a little hobby to do in my spare time. After stumbling through countless websites picking up little tidbits of information here and there (and spending ALOT more time and effort than I expected) I was starting to doubt if this was even possible to learn myself. As said before, I would pick up little bits of information and try to make my own little programs. I got very very basic information down but couldn’t comprehend how to to write anything more than a simple 20 line script. I was about to give up. Then I bought this book.and WOW. This book was absolutely amazing. I read it for hours everyday from when I purchased it. I finished the book 3 weeks later. I can say this book was monumental in what it taught me. (And it’s size too - LOL - the thing is massive but so worth the read)He teaches everything so simple and easy to read. Go through his lines of every example and try to understand what is happening. You’ll find by about page 500 everything is slowly starting to make sense. By page 1000 you’ll be thinking wow I can read and understand each example of code (even the longer ones). You start seeing how programs are put together, how every single line has a purpose. The syntax, the wording, the placement , the white space. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed learning programming from this book. It has enabled me to complete an online python course. I love solving problems on my own - each one is like a puzzle and I get a little joy when I successfully complete the challenge. Thank you Mark - for allowing me to experience this journey. I surely would have given up had I not found this book.This book is like sitting directly in his college lectures for a semester. Only I didn’t have to spend 4 months to get the information. I could learn as fast as I could read. All told it was a 3 week book for me and it was very very very worth it. I’ve purchased his second book (Programming Python) and hope it will be just as good as this one.If you’re serious about learning python than stop looking further. This needs to be a book you buy.The contents are expansive and in depth without overloading you. It’s taught in a simple easy to understand way. And the appendix is well laid out so after you finish reading it and get into the nitty gritty of programming you can always know exactly where to look in the book to get help on how to do something.

This is an excellent book for intermediate to advanced programmers looking for a methodical deep dive into the Python programming language.If you’re just looking to get started and up and running you’re probably going to find this book overly long and far too “in the weeds” to be useful. More frankly - I would avoid this book until your actually proficient with the Python language and actually want to become an advanced developer or you will be frustrated.Most people can get by hacking away at Python without being an expert at the language.There’s a large percentage of people that will be more than helped by the standard documentation that comes with a Python distribution and that is all they will need.“Learning Python” is more of an advanced text and would perhaps be more appropriately named as “Mastering Python”.

"I don't write too many reviews but I have to review this book. I'm just trying to learn the language to do some web, security, and rasberry pi development on my own. I tried to learn python over a year ago, got frustrated and quit. I tried to pick up the language again about 2 weeks ago. I have read and tried to work through Learning Python the Hard Way (LPHW). LPHW is a good resource and it did give me a general understand of the language. It teaches python version 2x. I have also read Dive into Python 3 (DP3). DP3 is also a good resource and it teaches python version 3x. I have also read and referenced  [...] For the most part, I am able to write simple code. But I got frustrated when I tried to review and understand complex code structures. I had a hard time understanding the nuances of the language. I spent hours searching online and watching tutorial videos. But I was constantly frustrated because there were all these exceptions that didn't make sense to me. I kept on asking why this works and why that does not work.The best thing about this book is that it explain the nuances of the language by giving multiple examples. So it does explains it in a complete manner. A lot of other resources will touch upon a topic and then glance over it. I often wondered.. what about this... so a lot of other resources expect you to test the other cases out which in most circumstance will be okay, but in others, you are still left wondering ""why?"". This book does not do that. In fact, I almost didn't need to try the examples on the interactive python command line because it was so thorough.This book is not for the beginner. You will get lost among the trees in the forest because there is so much information in this book. If you are impatient or need to start coding right away, you really won't be able to do this with Learning Python. LPHW and DP3 are much better at getting you up and running. But to write error free code, you have to understand the nuances of the language which Learning Python teaches you. Learning Python the Hard Way (free on the internet) and Dive into Python 3 (also free) are great resources to get introduced to the language. I would recommend both before you delve into this book. But once you get an understand of the basics of python, this book will fill in the missing details.As a disclaimer, I have only been reading this book for a day. I have already read 300 pages. A lot of it was review. But I learned a lot of new stuff as well that filled in the gaps. I have not read the section on regex or the more advanced sections yet so this review is not complete. But so far, I am impressed on the thoroughness of the subject matter.The main grip I have is that I bought the kindle version. If I read it in a linear fashion the material seem to flow nicely. But when I come to certain sections, I need to jump around. You find this a lot with any technical book. The kindle version makes this difficult because I cannot ""easily"" keep track of what I was reading so I get side tracked a lot. I also cannot effectively add notes (yes, I know I can add notes). I ended up using 4 devices to read this book just to keep track of where I was. I may get the hardcopy so that I have an easy quick reference book to look at later at my desk. With a hard copy, I use bookmarkers that I can quickly page to. I know about the kindle bookmarks but they are cumbersome to use. Fortunately, its hard to beat the fact that I can carry this book on my phone if I wanted to. So I would rate the kindle version 3 stars.Overall, I would buy this again on kindle.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
"This is a great, thorough, quality book on Python, targeted at individuals who have some experience writing programs, but who want to learn Python to write production-grade Python programs.All the people griping about how long this book is are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes the book is long, but to effectively use a programming language, there is a lot to learn.  And this book does a great job of metering out that information.  All the people griping about how there's too many ""forward references"" to other topics, are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes there are forward references, because there MUST be.  You can't learn every topic about a language in a linear way-- it's simply not possible.  If you are the target audience of this book, then you already understand that.If you've never programmed before, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a quick get-acquainted book about Python, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a reference manual for Python, this the WRONG book.  This book does NOT claim to be any of those things.  This book is a tutorial for people who have written programs before, who want to become an expert in Python.  If that's you, then you understand that the book is necessarily long.The Python language is a somewhat ""larger"" language than ""C"" or old-school Java.  So there is a lot to cover:  ""lists"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sequences"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""dictionaries"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""tuples"" are BUILT IN to the language, ""sets"" are BUILT IN to the language.  This is in contrast to the Java language or ""C"" language.  This book explains all of those BUILT INS and ""why"" they are built in.  If you aren't interested in any of that, then this is the WRONG book for you.This book also goes into detail about why the language is designed the way it is.  And it does this not only in regard to the high-level design of the language, but it does this for every nuance and detail of the language.  This is great information if your goal is to follow best practices when actually using the language for real world problems.  If you just want to write little toy programs and you don't care about best practices, then this is the WRONG book for you.The entirety of the Python ecosystem is MASSIVE, and this book goes into detail about a lot of that ecosystem.  (Although even a book of this size does not cover ALL of that ecosystem).  This includes things like:  embedding Python in a larger ""C"" application, calling ""C"" functions from Python, properties, metaclasses, decorators, Unicode, exceptions, object-oriented classes, etc., etc., etc.You think it's possible to learn all that detail, learn all the best practices of managing all those language features, and do it in a 100 page book?  Well, if you do, then you are not the target audience of this book.  People who want to learn to use Python to do production-grade programming realize that understanding all this detail takes a lot of pages, it takes patience, and it takes forward references.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"
"At 65 I am ""In-Progress"" in Learning (attempting) Python. There is so much information out there on Learning and ""Using"" Python that it is very easy to become Overloaded and almost Entangled with Unexpected Results. The ""Learning Python"" book by Mark Lutz is Incredibly easy to read. Almost like a novel in some respects, where you find yourself reading one more page, one more section, one more chapter. Detail flows, and is presented in a meaningful way that you do not become exasperated with the volume. Mark lays a Path from the Start that begins with what Python is and Is Not. Then how to install, and entry to how to use. From there the Journey Begins. Learning, Experiencing, Practicing, and Acquiring the knowledge in useful bites, maybe bytes....Mark has such a Fantastic Grasp on the Python Language that he uses his skill to Be Your Guide on Your Journey to Learning and Understanding How to Use Python. Whether in a Large Program, as a student, as a hobbyist, or as an integral component of your office work. He leads you on a level, paved pathway that leaves you with a smile.  His approach is so unique, that many who suggest his work do so in the matter that it is ""The Best"". I have to agree. I am an engineer and use C++ at an Intermediate Level. But found Python to be Overall Cumbersome and with many holes and obstacles to implementation.Following from Start to Finish, my Linear Way, and probably as most will suggest more than a touch anal, none the less his Learning Python has lead me to Where I am Now Able to Construct Applications that work. Here at home, and out in the field. Mark has such a fantastic way of presenting data, descriptions and how to avoid syntax errors, that you will come to the same conclusion of the all the others; That Learning Python by Mark Lutz is the Pathway Forward.Having a Copy of the Book on my desk while going through Tutorials from Udemy and a few other On-Line Learning Sites has increased my ability to obtain and use constructively what I learn, and where to look when I am unsure. I am sure some would think of his works as a Bible, I would interject the caveat that ""Yes, but it is so Well Written and Easy to Understand"". Wars will not break out. Will maybe.

"Just as a background, I am a software developer with 15 years software development in C, C++, Perl, and some Java moving into a position working with Python for the first time.  I was looking for a good Python ""techniques"" and basic fundamental language guide book, which is why I turned to the O'Reilly line (I have so many of their other books, from Perl to UNIX tools, to Java, etc.)  But, quite frankly, this book by Mark Lutz is very difficult to recommend (skip to the end for the TL;DR).  In a short version, it is very amateur, both from a writing perspective and a software development perspective.For the long version, first the bad points...  The author is either a half-baked software developer, or he is very good at coming across as one.  Statements like ""Python is better because it doesn't have the costly compile and link-time steps that languages like C does"" makes me tilt my head in wonder.  Does he not understand that ALL program execution has to be compiled to machine code?  And that if it is not done at development time, then the user of your code will surely incur that hit at runtime through an interpreter or some virtual machine?  The reason C (and C++, although the author usually names just C) compiles into machine code ahead of time is to save the runtime cost.  This isn't a ""Python is better than C"" issue.  It's a simple tradeoff that any real software developer realizes and makes use of.  If you don't need the runtime speed, then improving development cycle speed is a good thing, yes?  And likewise if you need a fast execution, taking the hit ahead of time so your users don't is worth it.  This is software development, something the author doesn't display a good job of fully understanding.In fact, half of the book reads like this.  From subjective, baseless assertions like ""most programmers prefer single-quotes [to declare literal strings]"" (???  Certainly not in my experience!) to constant ""rah rah"" Python proselytizing over other programming languages (C is a favorite target of his), it all shows a very shaky grasp on the ins and outs of software engineering.  He slams C's memory management and ability to get to the guts of a program, yet that is often required to create a sleek, highly efficient program.  He attacks C's syntax and praises Python's indent-based syntax without addressing the fact that Python tightly binds pretty visual formatting of human-readable code to machine execution flow.  To a seasoned software engineer, this is all about tradeoffs and using the right tool for the job.  Python does MANY things well, some MUCH better than C.  It's about using a hammer on a nail and a driver on a screw.  But you will have to wade through pages of cheer-leading and preaching from the author before you learn to actually USE Python.  If you are a C developer buying this book, you'd want to get to the nuts and bolts and just figure out how to use this tool to accomplish the job.  If not, you wouldn't understand all the constant comparisons and claims of superiority over C anyway.  ""WHY Python?"" the author asks. Because it is the tool to use for this job.  It's that simple.  I don't need the immature and insecure attempts to self-rationalize why Python ""REALLY is great guys, honestly! Much better than 'C'!""  I just need to know the syntax, libraries, and tips and tricks.Now for the good:  all that latter stuff IS in here.  You just have to wade through the self-actualizing, childish ego-trip to get to the juicy bits.  So, in the end, I'd recommend it if you don't mind fighting your way through what amounts to a half-book's worth of insecurities to find the information you need.",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"

"The most amazing thing about this 1500-page book is that it's incomplete without its sequel, the equally humongous ""Programming Python."" This book gives you a detailed tour of the basics of the language, its syntax and semantics and just a touch of actual useful programming. The real work, or so I gather, is in the sequel.However, this is a review of this book, not the sequel. That will come in a few months (which right there tells you I reasonably liked this book).The second most amazing thing about this book, then, is how clear it is.Python is a language both simple and complex: you can learn to write simple scripts in a day or so, but there is so much more to it. It is good for structured programming, declarative programming, and object-oriented programming (at least). It has a huge library of nice functions and widgets to add in as you need them - and that's just the official distribution.Lutz introduces us to the language without assuming anything other than that we have a computer and are able to do basic things with it (including accessing the Intartoobs). He writes in a clear and occasionally humorous style, borrowing variable names and such from Monty Python (after whom the language is named), and giving examples that actually demonstrate the points being made - though, aside from that, most of them don't actually _do_ much. (Again, that appears to be reserved for the sequel.)For someone with no programming background, this would probably be a do-able book. For someone like me who has such a background, though out of date, it's definitely right on the beam. (I picked this up because I wanted to learn a reasonably modern programming language; coworkers recommended either this or PHP, and I liked the name of this one better. Seriously...) For an advanced programmer, familiar with languages like Java and C++, it provides clear explanations of how (and occasionally why) Python is different from those languages. (Python has an explicit design and programming philosophy, the ""Zen of Python,"" built into the language as an Easter egg.)There's no real conclusion to be drawn here, other than that if you are interested in learning Python, this is a pretty good place to start.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Learning Python, 5th Edition"

"I very much enjoyed reading this book- cover to cover- the 380 pages of content- and then the additional glossary which in itself is a great resource. This book is not the ""nuts and bolts"" of how you do the standard statistical tests. This book assumes you have looked at other resources for the formulas.What this book does better than ANYTHING I have ever come across (and I have come across a lot of books on statistics and analytics over the years) is to get you to understand-really understand-- the key concepts, principles, assumptions and even mindsets that underlie the use of the basic-- and foundational-- statistical concepts.Prof Spiegelhalter has a remarkable ability to write and tell stories in clear and simple ways that get you to understand the essence of the principles. He walks you through many real and relevant examples so you understand the essentials of the underlying math models and mental models, and in parallel, that you also understand common mistakes and misconceptions.Some of you might say-- why do I need to visit-- or more likely- revisit these basic-- and ubiquitously applied- principles and methods? After all, isn't this becoming increasingly automated? Can't I just ""trust"" the outputs of my AI-enabled analytic systems?Exactly because the use of statistics has become so widespread, so deeply embedded in so many analytics and prediction systems-- it could never be more important than now to understand why people (and the models and systems they design) SO OFTEN misunderstand and misapply the basics. And these basics are foundational. They underlie so many aspects of modern analytics--- and even modern AI-based systems ultimately end up using these basics.All I can say is--- even though I have a MSc in Stats from Carnegie Mellon (1981), and have been involved with the use of data, statistics, analytics, and AI applications for decades-- I found Prof Spiegelhalter's way of walking a reader through the essentials of statistical thinking to be a joy to read. It has tremendously helped me to clarify my own understanding and mental models per statistical basics.This book truly works for people at ANY level. If you are just beginning with statistics- and you know the formulas but you still don't have the intuitions and insights- please read this book.If you work with stats on a regular basis--- EITHER because you are part of a team that uses statistical methods in your work products--- OR--- you regularly REVIEW work products that provide the results of analytic models-- You will find this book invaluable.And if you have to get other people to understand how to apply and how to NOT misapply basic statistical principles- this book is a hugely useful resource.Thank you Prof Spiegelhalter for producing this work. It is so easy to read. So easy to understand. And at the same time, so insightful, and so thoughtful-- in so many practical ways.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data

"Quite enjoyable and not so dry to read for a statistical book. Almost easy to understand but not that easy...Some point require more elaboration, for example in chapter 10, page 352:""the fact that this 95% interval include 0 is logically equivalent to the point estimate (-3000) being less than 2 standard errors from 0, meaning the change is not significantly different from 0""- i'm totally lost here, i failed understand what the author trying to tell. If there is any material in previous chapter that could help in understanding this sentence, the author should do some kind of revision before dive in. Otherwise, further elaboration is needed.""A two sided P-value is less than 0.05 if the 95% confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis (generally 0)"" -  Seem like a lot of info, but at the same time abstracted in statistical language.

"This is a nice analysis of not only statistics, but in many ways of the media as well. Media can twist study results to create a headline, but upon closer look what's declared in the headline is not really accurate because you have to ask a questions to see if the results / headline is significant. In terms of the theory behind the statistics, it's not a book that goes into the details of the equations. The equation may be listed or referenced, but not really explained, which is to be expected since entire courses are taught in order to understand and work with these equations. overall, a nice take on study results and really makes you think to ask questions when seeing study results reported in the media; quite relevant during these times, indeed.

"Though I am well versed in statistics as a financial professional, I often seek out books such as this one purporting to simplify the conceptual understanding of basic principles. Often my reading this type of material is to provide a basis for me to explain concepts to my clients and others in an understandable way.This book attempts to do away with much of the math and formulas of the discipline but to me the ideas became more of a struggle to understand without the ""convenience"" of math shorthand. Formulas are listed in the appendix but without the framework of explanation to make them understandable.I found the format confusing, often having to decipher the meaning of a graph, the details of a footnote and the textual explanation often on a single page. Definitely interferes with the flow of the material.  Parts of the book are excellent, especially when taking media and other folks to task for misusing statistical information and I found the explanations of simple, generic questions helpful but I think the average reader will find this a bit of a slog.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data
"Many books have sought to explain basic concepts of statistics with minimal mathematics, but this book will surely be the  ""gold standard"" for the 2020s.  It combines careful exposition with an impressive collection of interesting real data examples.  In part it treats the usual textbook basics -- summary statistics, graphics, randomized controlled experiments, sampling, regression, statistical significance, Bayes.  Then modern ideas such as algorithmic prediction (and one of my personal favorites, Brier scores).  It puts substantial emphasis on ""when things can go wrong"" and ""how we can do statistics better"" (both chapter titles) and on journalistic communication of statistical ideas.This book should be a required accompaniment to a traditional math-oriented first college course.[The 448 pages in the hardback version is rather misleading -- there are few words per page]",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data
"Data and statistics are core subjects in many disciplines, including economics and psychology, and are viewed very much with disinterest by those who are not concerned with them. That has much to do with the fact that statistics are all about numbers. Yet here is a book that has turned statistics into a fun subject. It rouses curiosity and enlightens us without pain. On the contrary, the book is written with exemplary clarity. Who were the kind of people that Harold Shipman, the serial murderer kill? Using statistics, the author goes on to answer questions such as whether Shipman could have been caught earlier? Does eating bacon increase our chances of getting cancer? How do we ascertain the accuracy of statistical studies? Are there tricks to be aware of, bearing in mind the oft quoted axiom – ‘There are lies, damned lies, and statistics’? This book has all the answers and you can read it with pleasure, finally understanding a dark art.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data

"Many aspects of today’s US House of Representatives—the expensive campaigns, the difficulty in having a one-on-one meeting with your elected representative, the lack of members’ time to oversee the federal government—are a direct result of its size having been capped at 435 members. That cap was enacted by Congress in 1929 so that one political party could gain a momentary advantage over another, writes historian Dan Bouk in the Epilogue of his new book Democracy’s Data. The cap let the party in power retain an extra seat.Prior to 1929, Congress frequently expanded the size of the House as the nation’s population expanded. But since 1929, the number of seats in the House has been fixed, and the number of people each House member represents has steadily increased. At the founding of the country, that number was typically between 30,000 and 40,000 people per member. Today, Delaware’s sole member in the House represents nearly a million people.The focus of Democracy’s Data is the 1940 US Census, but the story of why the House is locked at 435 members is one of those bonus pieces of context that make this book such a compelling read. This book is filled with details about US history and the history of today’s social problems—a history that today is largely untaught and rarely discussed.The text for Bouk’s lesson is the 1940 “manuscript census” — the digitized images of the paper sheets that Census Bureau workers carried from house to house in 1940 to record the nation’s data. The National Archives published digitized images of these pages on the Internet in 2012, and in the years that followed, Bouk and a few of his researchers read more than ten thousand of them. Some are reproduced in the book.Democracy’s Data starts with a meeting at the US Commerce Building of the “Question Men,” as Bouk calls them: the committee that met on March 3, 1939, to decide the questions that would appear on the next year’s Census. In the following pages, Bouk shows how these questions were influenced by the needs of America’s civilian, military and business leaders—as well as fears of the approaching World War and traditional American racism.In the following chapters, Bouk systematically explores one corner after another — some of them quite dark—to reveal untold details of the 1940 Census. Chapter 3, “Partners,” describes how this term was used to describe concentrated zones of same-sex households — “partners” — living together in places like Harlem, Greenwich Village, and San Francisco. (Confusingly today, the term was also used to describe Asian and Philippian immigrants living in work camps.) He then adds important modern context, telling the reader that for the 2010 Census, same-sex couples that declared themselves to be “married” had their data edited by Census Bureau statisticians, all to make each person’s data fit both the collection instrument and the Census Bureau’s conception of how data should be represented and processedBouk makes clear the benefits of a job with a Census Bureau at the tail end of the Great Depression—and the power that came with being able to dispense such jobs— in Chapter 4, “Counting with Friends.” The “friends” are the friends of politicians who were able to distribute such patronage jobs, and Bouk has uncovered many fascinating letters from archives to support his assertions. One delicious twist of this book is that Bouk frequently includes from the 1940 Census data for people whose letters he quotes, adding demographic color to the narrative.Throughout the book, Bouk dives deep as he explores how racism, white supremacy, and fear of Japan (which inappropriately translated into fear of Japanese Americans) shaped not just 1940, but the United States as a whole. He convincingly shows how decisions made eighty years ago are still with us today. He also covers the statistical indignities thrust upon Native Americans in the censuses of 1910, 1920, 1930 and 1940. On this topic, Bouk sadly misses several opportunities to go deeper. Interested readers will find significantly more information by using Google to search the Census Bureau’s website for the phrase “Indians not taxed.”One of the delightful aspects of this book is how Bouk periodically injects aspects from his own family history. The book’s opening scene is an encounter between “a census taker named Selena Catalano in the city of Rochester, New York” who “interviewed Nellie Oakden about her family:  about her husband, Howard, age forty-five, born in Pennsylvania, who had left school after the eighth grade; about Nellie herself, who had finished high school; about their children, beginning with the oldest, nineteen-year-old Joseph, followed by Hope, Howard Jr., Emily, and little eleven-year-old Nellie. Selena Catalano documented this encounter on a sheet of white paper about the size of the front page of a newspaper. Eighty-plus years later, all the data she recorded still exists. That is remarkable.”It just so happens that fifteen-year-old Howard is Bouk’s grandfather. “I never realized he was a ‘junior’ until I found his name listed on Catalano’s census sheet,” he writes.These kinds of details, personal reflections and context-filling make Democracy’s Data a pleasure to read, and highly informative.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Democracy's Data: The Hidden Stories in the U.S. Census and How to Read Them

I was very disappointed to see such a casual discussion of the Multiracial category during the 1990s. Bouk keys in on only one person who is Multiracial, but decided to be counted as Black for the census. I don't know of people who change their identity to satisfy the Federal government.

"I have bought this book as soon as it was published with great enthusiasm and anticipation. Unfortunately, after reading the first chapter on Fundamentals I am sorely disappointed. The didactic value of this chapter is non-existent. Even if the first version of this chapter might have been consistent and with some guiding thought, it truly seems like the author has decided to cut the individual paragraphs and paste them back in random order! To illustrate quantum indeterminacy, perhaps? For example, terms ""hermitian"" and ""unitary"" are used _before_ they are defined! The phase aspect of Bloch sphere is not explained at all leaving the reader wondering why do we need to bother with it at all. What does it mean that the ""H is separable"" (H being the Hilbert space)? Not explained at all!And the item that elevated my frustration to the point of triggering this review was formula for the Grover operator (equation 1.38 on page 27, also attached as an image). Grover's Algorithm is an important first illustration of quantum computing and a key to its understanding. Similarly, the Grover operator is the core item without which the understanding of Grover's Algorithm falls apart. And how does the equation 1.38 define it? Let me copy the image in text format:G = (2|psi><psi|-I)OAlthough the first factor is perfectly understandable, the ""O"" (second factor) is nowhere defined - not before, and not after! What is this funny ""O""? The reader is left in a superposition of frustration and disgust. :(Save your money, there are better books on quantum computing out there.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Quantum Machine Learning: An Applied Approach: The Theory and Application of Quantum Machine Learning in Science and Industry
"Great book, very timely and long awaited,  filling a huge gap in the filed of quantum ML. The author goes through the first 3 chapters addressing fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics and classical Machine Learning with hands-on examples. Then gets into the details of a subject that is possibly the hardest deep tech till to date. And he does it not just theoretically but also with codes, explained (phew). This is also the only book I have come across which takes on programming of D-Wave platforms (and also Xanadu) and spends at least two chapters on it.Highly recommended for anyone trying to get their heads around QML, given the disparity in platforms ( superconductivity, photonics, annealing...). This is a book written by a professional and researcher for others like him - 550+ pages of total dedication to the subject. I look forward to a second edition with codes updated (Google Cirq+Rigetti etc.)To the reviewer who have accused the author of not explaining stuff and especially the ""O"" in Grover's algorithm: He actually has explained it, it great details in Chapter 1, page 25 onward before that equation is quoted. That ""O"" is order of complexity. Please see the attached screen shot . This is not a subject one can shovel through in a hurry, requires a lot of patience, diligence and dedication.This book is NOT for people who wants to be spoon-fed information and not a book for Beginners in Quantum COMPUTING but for Quantum MACHINE LEARNING ( hence, some prerequisites and research mind-sets are required). Readers should know the difference between the two subjects. People wanting to get into Quantum COMPUTING should look at books meant for them, such as David McMahon, Jack Hidary or several other such books that are out there today.

"The author of this book has established a great reputation for himself as a shrewd investor and the founder of a successful and storied hedge fund. Bridgewater Associates has attracted the best and the brightest. Intellectual honesty, rigor and reportedly brutal candor are hallmarks of the firm. All which makes this book eagerly anticipated.And yet, this reader found the tome surprising for its lack of honesty. Worse, given the non-disclosure of at least one big fact, the work could be characterized as self-serving. Or, like war, is this book perhaps all about deception?Nowhere in the tome is there reference to Bridgewater Associates’ $1.25 billion raise for its third investment fund in China, as reported in the Wall Street Journal on November 24, 2021. This, to quote the Journal, would “catapult[s] the hedge-fund firm into the ranks of the biggest foreign managers of private funds in the world’s second-largest economy”. The book was released November 30, 2021. Was the author aware of the fund’s placement before he published? Would it affect the reader’s treatment of his subject-matter? One could guess ‘probably’ on the former and ‘certainly’ on the latter. The author’s work is his own, but he writes “[t]he people and tools at Bridgewater were also invaluable to this research.”As to honesty, let’s look at the testy issue of intellectual property – long seen as something at issue in US-China relations. While acknowledging “intellectual property” is a thing, the author devotes merely 6 references to intellectual property in the book. Six! One of them is about Americans stealing Chinese IP. Yet buried in a footnote is a CNBC Global CFO Survey that finds 20% of CFOs report to having had IP stolen by Chinese companies. To add insult to all innovators out there, the author contends that, you know, stealing IP has been going on, like, forever: “Stealing intellectual property has been going on for as long as there has been recorded history and has always been difficult to prevent”.Wow.Beyond the honesty, there’s just plain sloppy writing. Mr. Dalio may want to add a forceful editor to ‘triangulate’ with, to use his term for seeking counsel of notables. Consider this abominably ugly sentence, upon which a Kindle refund ought to issue:“For example, it is because of the United States’ great global successes that the US dollar became the world’s dominant reserve currency, which allowed Americans to borrow excessively from the rest of the world (including from China), which put the US in the tenuous position of owing other countries (including China) a lot of money which has put those other countries in the tenuous position of holding the debt of an overly indebted country that is rapidly increasing and monetizing its debt and that pays significantly negative real interest rates to those holding its debt.""One could go on. The rule of law, treatment of human rights, appropriation of private property, freedoms of speech, religion, assembly, climate change... All of these weighty themes are curiously absent in a true discussion of the author’s putative Ruler Of The World In Waiting.But what about insight on stuff the author knows a great deal? Money, central banks, reserve currencies and their role, historically in global growth and order? This is the stuff one could reasonably give Mr. Dalio a very high degree of competence. Well, here too the ball is dropped, hard. There was a lot of discussion here, but the discussion seemed frozen in 1990. There was materially zero discussion on arguably some of the tectonic shifts in history coming our way – some of which may truly change the world order. For example, how are Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and sovereignty-agnostic crypto to change the very nature of money itself? Or the world order therein? You don’t have to be a crypto bull to argue that digitization of fiat currencies is a Thing. That. Merits. Discussion. Yet here too, zero. Perhaps it was too sensitive for the audience in Beijing, given their own CBDC initiatives.A nit now, perhaps. But there are a lot of ugly meaningless charts. My candidate for indictment is the bell curve chart (reproduced in the photo attached to this review). It depicts two nations’ relative position of dominance in the world – the USA and China. The bell curve has ‘The Top’ at the peak and the label “CHN -> The Rise” on the ascendant curve, and “USA -> The Decline” on its descendant.  Would a sentence like “China is on the rise to the top, while the US is declining past its peak” do instead? And isn’t that really the only chart that Mr. Dalio wanted to impart in the whole book, given the audience in Beijing and the Bridgewater investment in China? More to the point, should we just have dispensed with all the charts and words and ‘triangulation’ and dinner parties with Lee Kuan Yew and paid our $16.99 for a Kindle version of that sentence?So to the reader-to-be, my advice is simply this. Save your money. The only real point is Mr. Dalio’s contention that China is on the ascendant slope, and the USA is past its prime. Because that is a message that resonates well with readers in Beijing, where he is wanting to be seen as playing nice.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"In this book, Dalio presents his model of the rise and fall of ""empires"". The closer it gets to the present day the more interesting the book is. The last three chapters of the book which deal with the rise of China, the current tensions between China and the US, the United States's alleged decline and Dalio's conjectures regarding the future are five stars. The build up to the final three chapters is decent, although only occasionally riveting: The book is only three stars before the strong close.It is hard to evaluate the merits of Dalio's historical model given that he is only presenting it at moderate depths so as to introduce it all in one volume. The model says that empires rise and fall, no surprise, and talks about the interplay of economic, internal, and external factors that take an empire through the cycle. Dalio also mentions that inside the Big Cycle there are other cycles, and inside those cycles other cycles. He does not, however, go into much detail regarding the sub-cycles. This sounds reminiscent of Robert Prechter's Elliot Waves or perhaps, even, pre-Copernican astrology. Is this a model so loose, like Elliot Waves, that it can be found to fit anything that could happen? Is it falsifiable? Along the way was the validity tested by approaching an empire that there was little prior knowledge of to make ""forward predictions"" regarding what would happen? Has Dalio merely cherry picked the three examples which best seem to demonstrate the soundness of the model while omitting more problematic cases? There is not enough in this book to do a rigorous analysis.The United States Civil War is a good example of something I had trouble thinking about in terms of the model. According to the model the final stage in an empire's breakdown is civil war or revolution. In the case of the United States, however, the Civil War occurred while the United States was still ascendant: in stage 2 out of 6 with stage 3 being the peak. Certainly there was no debt crisis which caused the Civil War and the United States had little going on in terms of external conflict at the time. So perhaps that could have been taken as a ""prediction"" that the United States would almost certainly have survived the Civil War in tact? The truth, however, is that the South came very close to winning the Civil War, in the sense of being recognized as independent, according to McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom.Another thing that I am not sure how to evaluate using the model is the United States after the Civil War and after the Revolution. Although these were periods of rebuilding they do not seem to fit well into Dalio's model. After victory in these conflicts Americans were very magnanimous (as it was later after World War II). Far from being purged those who were on the wrong side of history ended up facing rather little in the way of consequences. So how does this fit into the model? Obviously, there will be some ""rebuilding"" after a Revolution or Civil War so is the model just saying there will be something which could not not happen? Indeed although the United States was vibrant after the Revolution, the period after the Civil War as described in Richard White's The Republic for Which it Standards seems in decline compared to the Antebellum period. According to Dalio's model, however, the United States was stage 2 rising into stage 3 during this period.Regardless of the merits of the model, which would probably require many in depth books to evaluate fully, there is definitely some good high level overviews of Chinese, European, and American history. There are many interesting charts and statistics thrown in.As mentioned, the close of the book is far and away the best part of it. Dalio describes the cultural differences between Americans and Chinese people and their different outlooks toward governing. Dalio does not seem to be pushing any political agenda, at least not too hard, but rather what he has carefully measured to be objectively true. Although clearly an admirer of much about China, he is also willing to criticize some aspects of China. At the same time, his criticism omits its surveillance state.Looking forward Dalio presents some very interesting charts and statistics regarding America's growing internal conflicts. He even has a graph to show how bad it is now compared to early points in history. Dalio is willing to stick his neck out and quantify what his model is predicting as the probability of civil war in the United States and the probability of military war with China in the next decade.Although very thought provoking overall, one particularly persistent problem throughout the book is that many of the charts are very hard to read. There are graphs with eight different lines with some of the colors very hard to distinguish between. The book also almost never references its sources. Indeed, given how much history Dalio has obviously studied, a bibliography, or at least a list of recommendations, would be very nice.Dalio is very repetitive regarding the inevitable death of fiat currencies through money printing. At the same time he also does provide concrete advise of how to prepare. He gives some definite timelines and the dates are very close. To qualify this, somewhat, however, his company Bridgewater Associates has basically had a ""lost decade"" using his models to generate any kinds of returns since his departure around 2012. Nevertheless it is interesting to think about whether or the US is on the verge of multiple simultaneous crises.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"Dalio has a unique perspective on the topic of the changing world order. He is a successful businessman who has spent his career analyzing economic trends and patterns, and this book is a culmination of his findings. His writing is clear and concise, making complex economic concepts easy to understand.One of the best features of the book is its organization. The book is broken down into 14 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of the changing world order. Dalio starts with the big picture, examining the major forces driving the changing world order, before delving into the specifics of each major empire, including the Dutch, British, American, Chinese, Soviet, and Japanese empires. Ultimately, he brings everything full circle by discussing the changing world order today and what the future may hold.Another great aspect of the book is the way that Dalio weaves history and economics together. He doesn't just present economic theories in a vacuum; he uses real-world examples to show how they have played out over time. For example, in Chapter 5, he discusses the Great Depression and how it shaped the changing world order in the 1930s and 1940s. He also uses the rise of populism in Chapter 7 to illustrate how economic inequality can lead to political instability.Overall, I would highly recommend ""The Changing World Order"" to any intelligent human interested in economics, history, or politics. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the forces shaping our world today and what the future may hold. As Dalio himself puts it, ""understanding how the world works is essential if you want to accomplish your goals and live a fulfilling life.""Here are some key takeaways from the book:The changing world order is driven by three major forces: the changing relative powers of countries, the changing relative productivity of countries, and the changing values of countries.The rise and fall of empires is a natural part of the changing world order. Each empire has its own unique characteristics, but they all follow a similar pattern of rise, peak, and decline.The post-World War II order was built on the idea of free trade and cooperation between nations. However, this order is now under threat due to rising nationalism and protectionism.China is currently on the rise and is likely to become the world's dominant economic power in the coming decades. However, although this rise is not guaranteed, and there are many challenges that China will need to overcome, the US needs to step up its game on several fronts to compete.The future of the world order is uncertain, but there are a few things we can say with some degree of certainty. For example, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence is a hot topic today likely to have a major impact on the global economy in the coming years.Overall, ""The Changing World Order"" is a well-written and informative book that is sure to appeal to a wide range of readers. Whether you're a history buff, an economics nerd, or just someone who wants to better understand the world we live in, this book is well worth your time. As Dalio himself says, ""The more you know, the more you'll understand, and the more you'll be able to make informed decisions about your own life.""

"As Ray is winding down a monumentally successful career, he is making sense of what he sees happening in the world today. His ""principles"" efforts seem to me to be intended to capture and present the wisdom needed to navigate the 'interesting times' we find ourselves in.Ray frames history as a series of progressive cycles. While you might say, history doesn't repeat, the rhyme is worth paying attention to. We (the United States and the West) are in the chaos, or as Ray suggests decline phase of the cycle. In the finance world, we see the ""decline"" as the last gasps of this great debt cycle.Ray provides the metrics and measures he has been relying on for years to generate above-average returns in international markets. But ""Changing World Order"" is not so much a finance book as a treatise on the rise, then fall, then subsequent rise again of the human social order.

"I’m grateful Ray Dalio has shared his world view and his access to leading thinkers and valuable sources of data, to make me more aware and better prepared for what’s coming.  I am also friends with Ray, and I trust him.This book offers at least two major contributions.First, the synthesis and integration of economic, social, and geopolitical history that presents a holistic view of how countries rise and fall.  Leveraging his relationships with leading thinkers and historians, Ray gives us a way to understand the major forces, cycles, and paradigm shifts that can dramatically change the world around us.  You would have to read dozens of well-chosen books to gain such an understanding, and you still may not have a comprehensive theory.Second, the quantification of each major nation’s economic, cultural, and geopolitical health.  With the support of Bridgewater’s multi-hundred-million-dollar research budget and team, Ray presents the key determinants of a country’s strengths and weaknesses through time, and relative to other countries.  Seeing the most important long-term trends in charts provide useful perspectives that are unavailable elsewhere.Here are some of my biggest take-aways.Disorderly conflict is the pre-cursor to destructive conflict that is likely to be devastating for all of us.  Both the winners and the losers of destructive actions are worse off relative to compromise, mutual understanding, and respect.  As an American, I should not take for granted that I live in the most powerful country that has seen one of the longest periods of peace, economic growth, and innovation in global history.  It’s not the norm, and if we aren’t careful, things could get a lot worse.Invest in innovation.  Both as an investor and as a citizen, innovation has been a powerful force for improving lives and driving economic growth.We are likely in for a period of high inflation.  The easiest way for the government to deal with high levels of debt is by printing money, using stimulus to spur economic growth, and keeping interest rates lower than nominal GDP growth.  That is, to inflate their way out of debt.  As an investor, he suggests avoiding long term holdings of cash and bonds.  Instead, he recommends diversifying with assets that can do well in an inflationary environment, like highly dependable cash generating stocks, some gold (possibly a little cryptocurrency), and other scarce inflation-protected assets.This book is a major contribution.  I strongly recommend reading or listening to it.  If you don’t have the time, at least read the first few pages of the introduction, the first chapter “The Big Cycle in a Tiny Nutshell”, chapter 8 ""The Last 500 Years in a Tiny Nutshell"", and the final chapter called “The Future”.  I hope you found this helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail
"Great book. Dalio does a remarkable job seeing the bigger picture and providing confidence through historical events/ever repeating cycles that you can predict at a high level what is coming next for a given country or the world and plan accordingly. The corkscrew of evolution analogy is a perfect one, where the human race has up and down cycles but always trends up longer term thanks to technological innovation.My one criticism is he speaks out of both sides of his mouth in one instance, presumably because he doesn’t want to upset any high ranking politicians or leaders he may be friends with, which I found to be disappointing.On the one hand, he notes at the start of the book that no two democracies have waged war with each other, wars have only been fought between dictators/police states and democracies or just dictators/police states.Then later on when discussing China, he all but excuses and rationalizes their increasingly authoritarian state, as seen by Xi crowning himself leader until death and abolishing the precedent of 2 5 year term limits as of 2018. He blesses the Chinese approach of a few rulers knowing what’s best for all, as if those rulers are acting in the broader interest of Chinese people, and that’s an acceptable alternative to democratic rule. He cites the recent video game ban as having merit or at least being understandable, suggesting that he thinks the ends can justify the means. All the while there’s no mention of the atrocities of Mao under this authoritarian type of rule, no mention of the Muslim genocide going on now, the suppression of free speech and jailings and beating and murders of those that oppose the current regime, no mention of internet censorship, etc.To bring the criticism full circle, he doesn’t link his first point on wars and authoritarians always being involved in them, with the fact that China is an authoritarian state and therefore it’s rise threatens the free world and human progress. Ironically, he does correctly acknowledge China’s opening up to market and establishment of capitalist principles for rocketing them toward the US in terms of power, while refuses to critique the political system despite its history of failings, violence and pain. Russia invading Ukraine couldn’t drive this point (ie the civil or political system being as important as the economic system to the long term success of a country and world peace) home any harder.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail

"In my years as an IT Consultant, it was often a difficult task to provide information on a new technology to the multiple roles necessary in its successful development; and in a startup where a small team acts as everything from project manager to product leadership to software and hardware development roles this is particularly relevant, and this book fulfills all these needs to perfection.  Edge AI is an extreme example of this sort of technology embodying both software, algorithm development, embedded hardware and electronics, as well as management lifecycle and product marketing roles.  These expert developers: Daniel Situnayake and Jenny Plunkett both principals at Edge Impulse provide excellent direction which can be absorbed at all stages of this promising yet precarious development lifecycle.This book gives general background and instruction on what is Edge AI and Machine Learning providing clear explanations that can be grasped by less technical managers, as well as a detailed picture of what is necessary to create a realistic and successful development project that corresponds to a variety of use cases.  The book is roughly divided into three relatively independent yet complete sections, first a tutorial on the definitions, lifecycle and caveats of successful embedded AI development, secondly a detailed but not overly complicated section provided the specifics of a successful implementation and the development and engineering issues involved (this is the largest section in the book), and finally 3 widely divergent use cases involving wildlife conservation, food safety, and a consumer product giving sufficient detail to insure successful implementation of similar and dissimilar products.While this is not primarily a software implementation book sufficient detail is provided for the Edge Impulse ML/Ops framework to allow successful end to end development with a variety of tools.This is one of the best books I have seen in over forty years as an IT consultant in introducing and successfully implementing a new technology.--Ira LaefskyMS Engineering UPenn/ Wharton MBA formerly on the Computer Consulting Staff of Arthur D.

"I felt kind of ripped off when I first opened this.  It's Xerox quality printing wrapped in a nice printed cover.  At the time I ordered it, it said “Only 1 left in stock - order soon.”  A few days later, it still says that now.  Perhaps they print and bind these as needed.  Mainly though, I had misjudged the intended audience.  When I realized the intended audience, and the author's effort to make stats more hands on and there fore hopefully accessible, I have to acknowledge this may be a win.This is actually a book for maybe Seniors in high school and definitely Sophomore/Freshman in college.  The description of the phrase “resampling” takes three pages and involves muddy photos of someone drawing numbers out of a hat.  Chapter 8.3, about 3/5 of the way through the book is entitled “Understanding confidence intervals.”  (after regression)  So this is a book for beginners.  I hate foggy questions in textbooks so when it asks “What is the chief difference between a bootstrap distribution and a sampling distribution?” ..  I can just imagine students giving a good answer that gets marked down because it doesn’t reflect that instructor’s language in the course.  Conceptually these are chasing the same purpose and that’s what you want kids to know.When you realize this book is intended as a first adventure in basic statistics and R, however, you have to give it some credit.  It covers a basic smattering of the things they will actually encounter in the field.  Graphics are covered and there’s a section on drawing histograms with GGPlot.  There’s some tidyverse stuff.  Courses used to push more theory before going into regression, but these folks jump right into it.  That's probably a good call given how prevalent regression is nowadays.  It's a little scary since these machines can run off the rails, but it does make stats more real.  Throughout the book there's a back and forth focus between learning to code and learning to ""stat."" From what I saw skimming it, it seems to have a good balance in that regard.  They take a little time to help you learn data wrangling, so you're not totally lost when you move on to apply it somewhere and that's a good call.The 32 pages on sampling only have one page devoted to the central limit theorem at the end, but throughout that chapter, you’ve been doing hands on stuff about pulling samples to get the feel of this essential concept.  And I guess that’s the thing which stands out.  They use simple language, to draw you into the objectives and things we care about when we apply the tools of statistics.  For a given audience, that in itself is priceless.So, while it wasn’t at all what I thought it would be, and I know better than to buy something with the word “Modern” in the title, this does seem to be a refreshing approach for making statistics relevant and real to people as they are first initiated to this field.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)

"Stats is hard to learn and most introductory courses and books aren't good at teaching it.  As a data scientist it's taken me many years to understand it.  I have taken it as an undergraduate, taken it as a graduate student, and audited a class taught by a friend.  I have several books on introductory stats, introductory data science, introductory stats with R, etc.I could have skipped a HUGE amount of that effort had I had this a decade ago!  The authors clearly have experience with stats and with the challenges students face in learning it.  Rather than simply teach statistical theory, book starts with the practical process for exploring and analyzing data.  It then implements that process with simulation based statistics explained with practical examples readers could potentially repeat at home.  Finally, how to do all the calculations including a modern (tidyverse) process is shown step by step.Just that would be enough to make this the go to stats 101 book, but it goes beyond.  The book is written at an incredibly accessible level.  The book regularly repeats and references itself, helping ensure readers learn the statistics terms within rather than being confused as the term is only defined once and repeatedly used without re-definition, (a common occurrence in other books and classes).  It provides multiple practical examples at each step.  It even provides theory-based frequentist examples to help people understand the relationship between such theory based approaches and the main simulation based approach.  I can say I better understand theory-based statistics now, even though I focus on simulation-based statistics.Finally, the authors have created excellent tools to go along with the book. the `infer` Rstats package in particular provides a simple and clear way for readers to take what they've learned and implement statistics in the their own tasks.  The package is designed to enforce statistics concepts simply through it's process so that the effect of the book will live far beyond reading it.All in all, this is the stats book everyone should start with.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)
"I got into this book primarily to beef up my R and Tidyverse skills - and the book delivers. It's a very solid introduction to exploratory data analysis. Statistics education should be very closely intertwined with what a data scientist / analyst does day-to-day which is data wrangling and preparing for further analysis.Emphasizing the Tidyverse upfront for quick wins was a smart choice by the authors. Anyone who has used ggplot2 can attest to its visualizations capabilities over a point-and-click GUI like SPSS.The book simplifies the various statistical tests possible by presenting it under the general linear model focusing on regression, with the implication that t-tests and ANOVA are special cases. The ModernDive and Infer packages, of which the authors have developed and use extensively in the text, significantly streamline bootstrap re-sampling and subsequent creation and visualization of confidence intervals (and p-values). I appreciated the equal airtime for confidence intervals given the known problems around p-hacking.Sampling, Bootstrapping and Confidence Intervals are where the book really shines as it introduces simulations available with a statistical programming lang like R - - this was simply not available my first go around with SPSS.In the next edition, I'm hoping for an expanded discussion of trade-offs, if any, between re-sampling with vs without replacement and a discussion of bootstrapping strategies within the context of other sampling methodologies.All in all, I think this should be everyone's first course in statistical inference.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse (Chapman & Hall/CRC The R Series)

"My background: I'm an expert software engineer (C++, Java, etc) and proud n00b at machine learning.  I've read the O'Reilly ""AI and Machine Learning for Coders"" book and many online articles. I have a background in trading/financial software, which exposed me to many statistical terms in this book. In the past, PhD level physics/math quants would typically handle those topics and this book has helped me realize some gaps in my knowledge and fill them (sometimes via online search).  I can now at least reason about those concepts better even if I don't yet understand the details.I'm 1/3 into the book (so maybe premature for 5 stars) and it's been a dense but interesting read so far.  There have been times where I have to lookup terms but the material has still been approachable.  The language in the first couple chapters could probably be simplified some but it was sufficient for me with a lot of coffee.  I expect to still have very incomplete knowledge after finishing this book due to lack of practical experience. However, my goal is to build a large scaffolding of knowledge/concepts on ML that I can use as a foundation for future learning and broaden my toolbox before I start hacking code.  When I was learning C++, I found the Gang of Four book ""Design Patterns"" accomplished a similar goal to help bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical software engineering.  Much like with the GoF book I suspect I may be re-reading parts of this book in the future when my knowledge has matured.  Some may prefer doing a lot of ML coding before reading this book, but I like to have a lot of background knowledge/tools before tackling code - personal preference I guess.I seem to have discovered an error/typo regarding ""precision"" vs ""recall"" in chapter 3:Page 135 paragraph 2: ""If we care more that our model is correct whenever it makes a positive class prediction we'd optimize our prediction threshold for recall"".I think the last word in that sentence should be ""precision"".

"There are a lot of good ideas that spark the design patterns in this book. But when the authors explained their solutions to the problem, it was much too focused on promoting technologies related to Google Cloud and Tensorflow. In almost every section, the authors ""miss the forest for the trees""; the preferred trees are always specific Google sponsored technologies; the forest I was hoping for would be discussing the ideas in a technology agnostic manner. The original ""design patterns"" of object oriented programming were all technology agnostic, concept driven. This book is not like that at all.",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Machine Learning Design Patterns: Solutions to Common Challenges in Data Preparation, Model Building, and MLOps"
"I have the earlier version of this book which was based on Scala and it was great. I was so impressed that I used it to develop a course on Big Data Analytics at my university. So I was pleased when I learned the authors were planning a revised version based on PySpark, and decided to switch my course over this semester. Big mistake. The new book is filled with errors -- most of the code included in the book won't run unless you make significant changes, and the GitHub repository for the book still holds the code from the older version, at least as of this writing (mid-October 2022). You also get the impression from the text for some of the chapters that the revision was just slapped together without much care (to paraphrase, ""You could do this, but we won't show you how."")I do hope the publisher and the authors get together to fix this and issue another revision that addresses the many problems with the current one. If they don't, I won't be using this book again in my course next year and will have to look for another text.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Advanced Analytics with PySpark: Patterns for Learning from Data at Scale Using Python and Spark
"This compendium was due. On the one hand it provides an overview on the different approaches and techniques to digitalize chemistry. On the other hand it sets a clear vision for the future of chemistry: a radical new way to think the science of the matter everything is made from. It should be taught to every student that take the endeavor to become a chemist these days. With over 200 code examples it is bit hard to read for chemists, so python experience is necessary. On the other hand the theoretical introduction to the chemistry use cases are very short so that data scientists will jsut get a brief understanding of the subject. But fulfilling this would result in thousand+ pages. So this book is the first time that the fusion of this two areas is done and is successful.

Just started reading.. later review will come in more details,4.0 out of 5 stars,The Handbook of Data Science and AI: Generate Value from Data with Machine Learning and Data Analytics
"This is the first real data science handbook that covers all topics of data science, I have ever read. Others books cover only data management, modeling or business. But this covers really everything.In part 2, you learn about Data Science. It contains all essential topics from AI over NLP to Visualization. But also topics such as statistics and mathematics are covered. As mentioned above, the book claims to be holistic. You might skip the chapters of data engineering and business if you just interested on the modeling chapters, but I recommend not to do it. They contain really a lot of useful information and partly written by two leading data engineers in the field. Stefan Papp and Zoltan Toth have a high reputation on the international data engineering market.What I also love about this book is that each author brings his own perspective and voice. The AI chapter from Mr. Nikolic can be demanding for a beginner, but looking at his cv shows us that he is brilliant mind with an outstanding academic career. Mr. Meir-Huber writes from the perspective of a ""Tony Robbins for data"", he might not go so much into detail, but he is amazingly inspirational.This is a must-read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Handbook of Data Science and AI: Generate Value from Data with Machine Learning and Data Analytics

"The book compresses a lot of information regarding data engineering, machine learning, various platforms, etc. Overall it is a good entrypoint for someone with a CS background. As a data scientist, I find it also usefull while I could see other aspects of ML ops. However the book needs to be proofread. I am not referring to typos. There are copy-paste paragraphs (e.g., page 182) and many wrongfully written notations which mislead the reader. As an expert it is easy to understand these kind of errors. I also dont get why there needs to be code in the book. This is not supposed to be a guide on how to write data science code.Nevertheless, the book contains usefull information as I said and it is worth to read.",3.0 out of 5 stars,The Handbook of Data Science and AI: Generate Value from Data with Machine Learning and Data Analytics
"If you are a newcomer or experienced with AI, this book gives you a good overview of several aspects of data science. Each author is covering a different aspect of building data platforms. What I personally like is that each chapter can be read and understood independently from the other chapters, some are covering fundamentals other are written like a case study. Not all chapters are easy to read, depending on your ML background, but help you to gain more knowledge. I like the diversity of the authors, beside that they have an academic background in common, they have a different professional backgrounds.",5.0 out of 5 stars,The Handbook of Data Science and AI: Generate Value from Data with Machine Learning and Data Analytics

"The ""Digital Mindset"" attempts to make sense of the vast implications of a whole new paradigm of work, decisions, perspectives, definitions, relationships, obligations, and security; brought about by the digital context in our age. Whereas the authors emphasize “upskilling” throughout the text, they suggest that one ought to only master 30% of the key competencies to help ask relevant questions and make relevant direction toward key decisions in the first place. The book combines basic and advanced conversations into important themes entwined with well-researched case studies. They discuss key notions of data and analytics, human interaction with artificial intelligence (AI), digital presence, privacy and security. This is so far the best resource for understanding ""Digital Transformation"" especially Chapter 7 where they discuss ""leading as transitioning"".  They not only urge leaders to accept and embrace digital-driven change, but to also design and align systems and processes to integrate the right digital tools as we transition to digitization. This is a huge resource for the complete tipping point of paradigms that our generation is only starting to understand. This is an important digital transformation reference book because of its generous and careful illustrations carefully annexed. I highly recommend this book for all leaders in every field globally.

"Here is a prediction from Alvin Toffler in 1970: ""The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.""That's what it really takes to thrive in the Age of Data, Algorithms, and AI.I cannot recall a prior time when the global business world was more volatile, more uncertain, more complex, and more ambiguous than it is today. In their latest book, Paul Leonard & Tsedal Neeley explain how and why almost anyone can develop a digital mindset, one that will enable them to ""see the world in new ways, and to ask new, big, important questions.""The same mindset will enable workers to collaborate effectively when their human intelligence interacts with artificial intelligence.Leonardi and Neeley: ""A mindset is a set of approaches we use to make sense out of the world. How you approach something shapes the way you think about it, its importance to you, and how you act.""More specifically, a digital mindset is the set of approaches we use to make sense of, and make use of, data and technology. ""This set of attitudes and behaviors enable people and organizations to see new possibilities and charts path for the future. Big data, algorithms, AI, robotic teammates, internal social media, blockchain, experimentation, statistics, security, and rapid change are some of the major digital forces that are reshaping how we interact with our colleagues and creating new demands to restructure organizations to become more competitive.""Leonardi and Neeley stress the importance of redefining fundamental ways of approaching and then becoming engaged in three key processes: Collaboration, Computation, and Change. ""New, concrete skills are needed, of course, because they give us vocabulary, knowledge, and intuition to see the bigger picture -- to ask the important questions. Developing a new mindset means that you build from your new skills to see the world in new ways and to change your behavior accordingly.""This is precisely what Toffler had in mind more than 50 years ago.The WHATs of business success have remained essentially the same since the oldest known markets in ancient Persia, from where they spread to the rest of the Middle East and Europe. Documentary sources suggest that zoning policies confined trading to particular parts of cities from around 3000 BCE, creating the conditions necessary for the emergence of a bazaar.I am again reminded of an incident that occurred when a faculty colleague of Albert Einstein encountered him on the Princeton campus and gently chided him for asking the same questions on his final examinations every year. ""Quite true. Guilty as charged. Each year, the answers are different."" The same is true of the HOWs of business success today.Paul Leonard and Tsedal Neeley have made a uniquely valuable contribution to thought leadership:  HOW to respond effectively to unprecedented challenges posed by data, algorithms, and AI. Better yet, they suggest and explain HOW the digital mindset can formulate new and better approaches to collaboration, computation, and change. ""Your digital mindset is something of a superpower. You can unlock opportunities you may never have imagined. This power is so much h more than knowing how to code and how to do data analytics. You will no longer be ashy about diving into conversations about technical topics, and you have a technical language that creates entirely new possibilities.""Perhaps the most important thing about your digital mindset is that you don't have to worry about finding your place in the digital future.""This is a ""must read"" for every C-level executive (or equivalent) as well as for anyone else who aspires to become one.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Digital Mindset: What It Really Takes to Thrive in the Age of Data, Algorithms, and AI"
"Data science is put in excellent perspective in this book.  I think the book is especially oriented toward giving people interested in ""specializing"" in this field or utilizing data science some good, basic information.  As a multidisciplinary field, and one oriented toward business, government and surveillance interests, generally, it is a field that encompasses and extends into practical areas that its associated traditional area, namely statistics, has not in the past much-addressed.  Data science is an extremely interesting, technical field with broad social and ethical implications explored in this book.  Statistics is only one tool.  The authors lucidly discuss the focus on the huge amounts of valuable, unstructured data.  They point out that to make all of this useful for the goals and purposes of business, surveillance, medicine, government, etc. requires an enormous time investment in putting appropriate data together and extracting information in a usable form.  The discussion of mathematical modeling, machine learning, and the overall use of algorithms is very insightful.  The authors make it clear that data science is not merely ""deep learning"", despite the fact that the extraordinary advances in using neural nets represented by deep learning is largely responsible for much of the importance of data science today.  There are excellent perspectives of data science available on the Internet, but I think the authors of this book have provided a good supplement for this information in a deeper way.  One of the real problems in picking information out from the Internet is escaping  the ""hype"" surrounding a subject that is currently ""hot"" like data science.  This book definitely allows the interested person to separate some of the solid pieces of knowledge about what the field involves from the huge amount of ""noise"" surrounding the entire area of ""weak"" AI and machine learning.  I would recommend this book strongly to anyone seriously considering going into this field.  A point the authors stress is that weak AI, namely specialized applications, rather than broadly ""intelligent"" systems competitive with general human intelligence, has opened up a world of opportunity, promise, progress, as well as ethical dilemmas.  I personally think that data science is a great field for an enormous spectrum of technicians at all educational levels.  The book opens a window a bit on the enormous implications for our future.  It is a good start on the climb to a satisfactory knowledge of this field and its potential.  I especially recommend the book to business executives and entrepreneurs as a useful and insightful view, for developing a strategic picture of this field, that does not get into unnecessarily technical details, and is not subject to the ""hype"" and ""noise"" from the Internet.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)
